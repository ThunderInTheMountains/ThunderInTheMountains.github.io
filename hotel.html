<p>
We will again be at the Crowne Plaza - DIA as the venue for Thunder in the Mountains 2016. We would like to thank the Crowne Plaza for their support to make our event successful, and we are delighted to have formed a partnership with them for years in the future.

<h5 class="clearfix"><span>$160</span> <span>(plus taxes and service fees) for single, double, triple, or quad rooms.</span> <span>Suites are priced higher and prices may be obtained from the Crowne Plaza</span></h5>

<p>
Credit cards will be charged one night charge at the time of the reservation, the remaining nights will be charged on check out. You will be required to have a two night minimum stay this year.  Also please NOTE that if you wish to book multiple rooms you will need to contact Rich at <a href="mailto:rich@thunderinthemountains.com">rich@thunderinthemountains.com</a> or Brian at <a href="mailto:brian@thunderinthemountains.com">brian@thunderinthemountains.com</a> for approval.  The hotel will contact you first if the charge does not go through before canceling a reservation.  If you wish to cancel your reservation you MUST do so before July 1, 2016, or you will be charged for one room night even if you do not attend. This policy is to prevent people who are not sure they really want to attend Thunder from reserving rooms and not canceling them until the last minute, thereby preventing others from getting rooms in the host hotel. So, reserve your rooms early, but if you don’t think you can attend, be sure and cancel them before July 1, 2016 to prevent an unwanted charge to your card. 
</p>
