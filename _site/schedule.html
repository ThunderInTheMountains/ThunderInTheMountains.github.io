You will also learn to use your body as a tool for impact play and engage in very intimate physical contact with your partner.  The scene becomes a kind of close quarter combat for kinky people and you learn an unarmed combat skill you can use in your day to day kinky life with your partner.

<!-- 			{"title"=>"Fisting", "description"=>"<p> Handing complete control of your sphincter, your anus, your rectum, and your lower colon to another human being can be one of the most daunting experiences a person can undergo.   This type of play involves a huge level of trust by the fistee of the fister, but once this trust has been established, fisting can become one of the most personally emotional and satisfying types of play anyone can participate in.   As a result, fisting becomes one of the most intimate ways to touch and make love to another person.  In this class, Mark Frazier will discuss the proper techniques of entry by the top, ways to relax by the bottom, the safety concerns, and dealing with the unreal feeling of \"openness\" and connection with another person.  If you are one of those people who wants to experience this beautiful type of play or if you are one of those who have already indulged in it and want to learn more, then this is a class you HAVE to attend! </p><p>Bottom Wanted - Interested in bottoming for this seminar, contact e-mail via <a href=\"mailto:rich@thunderinthemountains.com?subject=Frazier Demo Bottom\">rich@thunderinthemountains.com</a></p>", "datetime"=>2016-07-24 09:30:01 -0600, "endtime"=>2016-07-24 11:00:01 -0600, "location"=>"Telluride", "name"=>"Mark Frazier"}{"title"=>"Sensual Domination - A Kinky Tutorial in Erotic S&M", "description"=>"<p>Everything in a scene can be made sensual; everything can be made dominant.
