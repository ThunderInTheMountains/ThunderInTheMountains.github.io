- name: Dart
  title: 
  linkname: Dart's Domain
  linkurl: http://www.sirdart.com
  bio: Master Dart's interest in leather and BDSM play can be traced as far back as his early childhood years, citing a huge fascination with what was being done to don the “Batman” television series…and to the furry cowboys on “Gunsmoke.” When other boys were caught with porn magazines under their beds…Dart was caught with a roll of duct tape. Since then he has developed an immense passion for rope bondage, not to mention the men he likes to tie up with it. Dart began his leather journey as a collared boy and gradually developed into the dominant he is today. He believes in the importance of “balance” when exploring one’s dominant and submissive side in play, and that great benefit can come from experiencing both elements. Master Dart’s kinky interests in addition to rope bondage include puppy play and training, chest and gut punching, and most recently, fire play. He sees himself as "proudly New Guard" because he feels that what is most important is not what happened in the past but what is happening NOW, and that our sexual self-expression should not be hindered by rigid or judgmental 'rules' from our past.  Among the cities, organizations and events Dart has presented in include sitting on the educational board for “Mr. Leatherman Toronto,”  “Spring Iniquity” in Houston, “Thunder in the Mountains” in Denver,  “GEAR Ireland” in Dublin,  “Leather Pride” in Amsterdam, and the “Rome BDSM Conference.”   He also hosts his own leather podcast program on ITunes, called “Dart’s Domain.” He shares his life with his husband Sir Bart. They reside in Virginia Beach, VA.

  class1title: Landmines
  class1description: In kink and BDSM, we all bring a certain amount of 'baggage' to the table. And some of us even bring freight!   While these are elements of what makes us all human, they can become a critical issue when it comes to the intensity of the power exchange that exists in a kink relationship. A LANDMINE refers to what happens when a negative element of our past gets triggered during the course of that relationship, be it in play or otherwise. In this class Master Dart will facilitate a discussion about some of the possible landmines that can come up in the course of a D/s relationship or playscene, and how we can deal their accidental detonation and grow from them.

  class2title: Puppy Love
  class2description: ARF ARF!! Embrace your inner canine!  These are sounds that you will likely hear more and more inside and outside of kinky play scenes around America and the world.  In this workshop and demonstration Dart will cover the fundamental aspects and safety issues surrounding this rapidly growing phenomenon of puppy play. Dart’s demonstration will show both handlers and future “pups” the playful elements and the psychology in this fun and popular form of play. If you have been interesting in exploring the canine within you and/or your sub, and you want to attend this highly informative class, you should wear comfortable clothing and be prepared to “move” as Dart has you exploring this high-energy and transformational power exchange!

A late-night encounter with a young woman he met online in late 2005 piqued his curiosity about BDSM.

  class1description: <p>"Autoscopy" is associated with looking back at one's own body from a vantage point or position outside of the physical body.</p><p>Cases of it have been attributed to everything from delirium and psychosis to astral projection.  Autoscopy is also associated with seeing one's double or a duplicate of one's own body.</p><p>Using video glasses and cameras we can simulate autoscopic experiences within BDSM scenes, adding another dimension to play.  Everything from candle wax to terror play becomes more intense while the bottom is "outside their body" witnessing it.</p><p>In 2011 "Watch Yourself - BDSM with Video Glasses" was featured in SECRET Magazine No. 36.

  class1title: Choose Your Own Edge Play Adventure
  class1description: Do you find Dexter's kill room to be scary and erotic? Have you gotten aroused by war crimes depicted in a documentary? This is dark, potentially dangerous stuff to play with, but in this class as a small group we will explore these feelings with an emphasis on bringing those fantasies to life in a safe and risk- aware manner. We will dissect several examples of realistic, potentially criminal activities with the purpose of figuring out how to safely enact a fantasy version of those. Many of these examples use restraints less commonly found in kink which each carry their own risks.  In order to decrease the risk we will discuss, demonstrate, and use specific means of restraint and destruction.  If you have ever found yourself fixating on some of the darker aspects of real-life crimes and you have craved some sort of guidance to play safely in these realms, this is a class you won't want to miss!

  class2title: Rape Play - From Curious about to in to in one class
  class2description: According to many surveys, one of the most popular fantasies among both gay and straight audiences is that of rape.  Through force or coercion and independent of gender, rape play can be terrifying and erotic for both the top and bottom.  In this class Frozen Meursault will take a "how-to" approach on a number of actionable teaching points for attendees to begin employing as they explore rape play in the scene. Safety issues will be stressed with an emphasis placed on recognizing risks and mitigating them to give participants a foundation upon which to build as they enter this psychologically tricky form of play. By focusing more on practical points than lofty discussions this class is an effective jumping off point for actual, hot sexual play.

  class1title: Engage - Dynamic bottoming
  class1description: Being the receptive partner doesn’t mean that your only value comes from your physical appearance, ability to take pain, or capacity to stay on your knees for hours on end. Bottoming skills are frequently overlooked, but any top who’s had the pleasure of playing with a truly dynamic bottom will agree that they are they are the skillziest skillz in BDSM! Whether your dynamic is brat play or high protocol Master/slave, there are verbal and non-verbal methods you can use during the scene to give feedback and guidance to ultimately make a more satisfying experience for yourself AND your top. In addition to the focus on in-scene communication, this class will include interactive activities to help you approach tops for play, discussion about negotiation (hint - it isn’t just passively being interrogated by the top!), and tips on taking care of yourself before & after a scene. (This class contains elements of demo, lecture, discussion, and class interaction.)

  class2title: Penetrate - Advanced Play Piercing
  class2description: Make dramatic and imaginative needle art, connect spiritually with your partner through energy work that literally gets under their skin, or just be a sadistic asshole- this class on advanced needleplay techniques will give you the tools! Depending on the interests of the attendees (which will be surveyed at the start of the session), technical skills covered may include using body jewelry and piercing needles for play, using larger gauge needles (16, 14, and bigger!), needle bondage, zippers, predicaments, using IV needles for surface piercings, crossing patterns, weaving, using suture sets, threading, genital piercing, decorative needle play, and impact play over needles… but this class is about more than technical skills, so it won’t stop there! Stefanos & Shay will also discuss types of needle play scenes, spirituality for needle play (including doing a needle pull), and execution in context. “Play piercing 101″ level knowledge & experience are required to attend this advanced-level session. Beginning play piercing techniques and safety/negotiation topics will NOT be reviewed. If you can, please bring a minimally furry stuffed animal to class with you- you will pierce your completely consenting “stunt stuffie” to practice as we go along! Supplies for in-class use (and some loaner stuffies) will be provided. (This class is demo, lecture, discussion, and hands-on- how much of each component depends on the interests of the class.)
