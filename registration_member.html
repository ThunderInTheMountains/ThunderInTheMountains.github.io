			At the door, we'll request that you fill out a membership application to the <em>Thunder in the Mountains, LLC</em> group. Below are the regulations for this membership which you may read here to alleviate your wait time when you're at the door!
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I am familiar with and understand the subject matter and nature of the practices of bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, power exchange between willing and consenting adults, homosexuality, bisexuality, heterosexuality, fetishism, and other related sexual and/or dominance and submission activities. I further state and agree that I find none of these subjects or activities to be offensive or objectionable to me in any manner whatsoever.</li>
				<li>I do not find patently offensive or lewd any act of sexual intercourse, any act of deviant sexual intercourse, insertion of one or more fingers or other objects into the mouth, vagina, or anus of another human being, masturbation in any form, caressing or fondling of the genitals, representations or imitations of sexual intercourse, masturbatory or excretory functions whether or not accompanied by an exhibition of the genitals, or the fondling in any manner or caressing of the body of any person of either sex by either sex.</li>
				<li>I agree that I am joining a private organization, not open to the public. As a member of <em>Thunder in the Mountains, LLC</em>, (“<em>Thunder</em>”), I willingly and with full consent and knowledge waive and relinquish any claim, legal or otherwise, that I might make as to the offensive nature of anything I might see or experience while a member of <em>Thunder</em>. Should I at any time attempt to make such a claim, I understand and agree that I would do so solely as a means of entrapping and/or soliciting the arrest of other members of <em>Thunder</em>.</li>
				<li>I understand and agree that <em>Thunder</em> is a private membership organization and that the privacy of all other members of <em>Thunder</em> is of paramount importance to such members. For that reason, I represent and agree that I am not joining <em>Thunder</em> or attending this event as a news/media/broadcast reporter in any capacity or as an investigator for any news/media/broadcast outlet in any capacity. If I should divulge to any news/media/broadcast organization anything I see, hear, or photograph while attending this event as a member of <em>Thunder</em>, I acknowledge and agree that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to estimate the damages that <em>Thunder</em> might incur for such disclosure. Therefore, I agree that a reasonable estimate of the total detriment that <em>Thunder</em> would suffer in the event of such disclosure is and shall be, as the sole and exclusive remedy and not as a penalty, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (“Liquidated Damages Amount”). I recognize and agree that the news/media/broadcast outlet and I shall each be held separately liable to <em>Thunder</em> for such Liquidated Damages Amount.</li>
				<li>I agree not to bring to or consume any alcoholic beverage or illegal or illicit substance of any sort at any meeting, seminar, or other type of gathering of any sort sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>, except that I may consume alcoholic beverages at an event held specifically in conjunction with a bar where the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is legal and expected.</li>
				<li>I agree that I will never solicit for, negotiate, or consent to any form of payment for sex during any meeting, seminar, or other gathering sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>. I am aware that such conduct is illegal pursuant to state and local laws.</li>
				<li>Should I violate either paragraph 5 or 6 above, I agree to be immediately ejected from any <em>Thunder</em> event and to forfeit my membership in this private organization.</li>
				<li>I am at least twenty-one years of age. I agree to produce a valid driver's license or other valid I.D. in order to obtain my membership card prior to entering any event sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>, in order to prove my age and identity.</li>
				<li>The name presented is my true and legal name and is not an alias.</li>
				<li>I assume the risk of injury incident to my attendance and participation at meetings, seminars, and other events sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>, and I agree to hold harmless <em>Thunder</em>, its officers, directors, organizing committee, volunteer staff, and members, and the Crowne Plaza DIA, the building management, the building owners, and their agents, successors, and assigns from any claim of liability by me that may arise out of my attendance and participation at meetings, seminars, and other events sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>.</li>
				<li>I agree not to bring in any camera, cell phone camera, cell phone capable of either recording voices or recording any sort of images, or video recording device into any event sponsored by <em>Thunder</em>, including the vendor areas, seminars, demos, and the dungeon. I further agree that should any camera, video recording device, or audio recording device be brought to a <em>Thunder</em> event by me or by someone acting on my behalf, such equipment will be subject to immediate confiscation and destruction.</li>
				<li>I understand and agree to comply with the specific rules which apply to the dungeon, as follows:<br/>
				Specific rules which apply to the dungeon are as follows:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>No alcohol or any illegal drugs or illegal substances of any kind may be brought into the dungeon. Anyone who is noticeably affected by either alcohol or drugs will be denied admittance or asked to leave by the Dungeon Master/Mistress.</li>
					<li>All attendees of <em>Thunder</em> will be required to present a membership badge for admittance to the dungeon and other events. There will be NO exceptions to this rule, so please be sure to bring your badge!</li>
					<li>Smoking is prohibited in the active dungeon space. Smoking will be permitted only in designated areas outside the dungeon.</li>
					<li>Prostitution, solicitation, and negotiation of compensation for sexual services are illegal and will not be tolerated. Any violator will be immediately ejected from the premises and their membership forfeited.</li>
					<li>Food and drink (with the exception of water) may not be brought into the dungeon. Snacks &amp; drinks will be provided in a social area.</li>
					<li>No cameras, cell phones of any kind, and video or audio recording devices of any kind will be allowed in the dungeon. Even if the cell phone is not capable of taking pictures, all cell phones are banned from the dungeon. Any person seen with any such devices shall be immediately ejected from the premises and their membership cancelled. </li>
					<p>**NOTE: NO CELL PHONES OF ANY KIND IN THE DUNGEON DURING THE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT PLAY PARTIES. THEY WILL BE CONFISCATED AND MAY BE DESTROYED!</p>
					<li>For everyone's protection, we ask that you use the rubber gloves and cleaning supplies located throughout the dungeon.</li>
					<li>All players will be required to clean up their play area after their scene has ended. Please leave all equipment free from sweat, blood, semen &amp; vaginal fluids, wax and toys. If you do a scene involving wax, blood, or urine, please use a drop cloth which will be provided. Bring any bodily fluid contamination to the notice of the proper Dungeon personnel.</li>
					<li>Normal dungeon etiquette is required. Do not intrude into or interrupt any scene unless specifically invited by a participant. Do not touch anyone or anyone's gear without permission.</li>
					<li>Watching from a respectful distance is permitted, but please keep all conversation, laughter, and comments to a minimum in the dungeon space. DO NOT talk to the players while the scene is progressing.</li>
					<li>Dungeon Masters/Mistresses must be obeyed at ALL times. If someone is breaching dungeon etiquette and your scene is being disturbed or you are being bothered unduly, please notify a Dungeon Monitor.</li>
