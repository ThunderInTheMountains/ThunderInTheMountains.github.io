  bio: Since his introduction into the BDSM lifestyle in the early 90s, the "Kinkstar" Simon Blaise has shared his passion for BDSM with the world as an international presenter at BDSM/Leather events across the globe for the last 9 years. As an attorney, he has provided pro bono legal services to members of the BDSM, Leather and LGBTQ communities for the last 10 years. As an intersex transgender person with multiple personalities, who was born both genders and lives equally as both a male and a female, he hopes to pave the way for others in our community to feel more comfortable about living authentically and openly. Simon's ultimate goal is to be a part of helping society see BDSM as a beautiful and rewarding subculture that deserves all the legal protections afforded to other minorities.   Recently, Simon Blaise, along with his soul sister Alexandria Blaise, were given the distinct honor and privilege to serve as Rocky Mountain Person of Leather 2014.   Simon has revolutionized fire play with his innovation of fire torches he calls, Blaise Sticks that allow for longer burn times (approx. 15 min), safer fueling techniques, and less refueling, which means more fire play. He is also responsible for the introduction of his Blaise Wrap Suspension technique to the kink community, bringing a whole new dimension to suspension while providing a much safer alternative to rope suspension. Simon's latest innovation, Blaise Floggers, provides a safer alternative to "fire flogging" that actually gives the bottom the sensation of both leather and fire simultaneously.   Simon teaches courses on fire play with Blaise Sticks, polyvinyl suspensions using the Blaise Wrap technique, flogging, canning, single tail, violet wands, M/s relationships, improving one's scene with connection and spirituality, and much more.

  linkname: Dart's Domain
  linkurl: http://www.sirdart.com
  bio: Master Dart's interest in leather and BDSM play can be traced as far back as his early childhood years, citing a huge fascination with what was being done to Robin on the “Batman” television series…and to the furry cowboys on “Gunsmoke.” When other boys were caught with porn magazines under their beds…Dart was caught with a roll of duct tape. Since then he has developed an immense passion for rope bondage, not to mention the men he likes to tie up with it. Dart began his leather journey as a collared boy and gradually developed into the dominant he is today. He believes in the importance of “balance” when exploring one’s dominant and submissive side in play, and that great benefit can come from experiencing both elements. Master Dart’s kinky interests in addition to rope bondage include puppy play and training, chest and gut punching, and most recently, fire play. He sees himself as "proudly New Guard" because he feels that what is most important is not what happened in the past but what is happening NOW, and that our sexual self-expression should not be hindered by rigid or judgmental 'rules' from our past.  Among the cities, organizations and events Dart has presented in include sitting on the educational board for “Mr. Leatherman Toronto,”  “Spring Iniquity” in Houston, “Thunder in the Mountains” in Denver,  “GEAR Ireland” in Dublin,  “Leather Pride” in Amsterdam, and the “Rome BDSM Conference.”   He also hosts his own leather podcast program on ITunes, called “Dart’s Domain.” He shares his life with his husband Sir Bart. They reside in Virginia Beach, VA.

A late-night encounter with a young woman he met online in late 2005 piqued his curiosity about BDSM.   In 2006 he officially entered the scene, and by late 2007 he had purchased his first electrical gear and was off and running, giving demonstrations shortly thereafter.</p><p>Known for bearing a sadistic grin and being frequently accused of "evil," he is a member of the Society of Janus, a Founder of the Boise BDSM Society, creator of the "Idaho BDSM" group on FetLife, administrator of <a href="http://IdahoBDSM.com" target="_blank">IdahoBDSM.com</a>, and a writer of published articles in “SECRET Magazine” from Belgium.
