- title: If You Like It, You Should Put a Ring On It! Cock and Ball Accessorizing 
  description: <p>This highly interactive class will look at sexy, intense, and entertaining ways to “decorate” the cocks in your life. Stefanos & Shay will start with a basic discussion of anatomy, safety considerations, negotiation, and circumcised vs. intact vs. strap-on cocks, then move into formal accessories like cock rings and chastity devices — you’re encouraged to bring your favorites for “show-and-tell”!</p><p>They will then demonstrate multiple cock and ball bondage techniques, including using bondage to create a cock ring, wrapping everything up in a neat (and easy!) package, making a cock “helicopter,” creating a kynodesme (google it!), and cock bondage for chastity. Class participants are encouraged to practice along and get creative!</p><p>The instructors will provide cord for in-class use. They may be able to pair people up (or you can practice on yourself), but you’re encouraged to come to this session with a willing “stunt cock” of your own. </p><p>This class is demo, lecture, some discussion, and hands-on. Participation appreciated!</p>

- title: Precipice - Extreme Edge Play
  description: <p>Violent assault, humiliation, terror, interrogation, forced sex… playing on the brink can be vastly rewarding, but also psychologically and physically dangerous (which is of course part of the appeal). Stefanos & Shay will demonstrate & discuss types of edge play scenes, negotiation & aftercare for this type of play, and the how & why of taking yourself (and your partner/s) to the limit… and then pulling them (and yourself) back.</p><p>This class includes numerous demos, including emotional edge play, sexual consensual non-consent, gun play, use of “trigger words,” realistic and personal portrayal of domestic abuse, and rough body play, as well as participatory discussion about “soft limits” and risk awareness in the context of edge play. Throughout, Stefanos & Shay emphasize using edge play for catharsis and empowerment.</p><p>This class is not for beginners and contains content that many participants find triggering (often in unexpected ways). NO LATE ENTRY allowed for this session. </p>

- title: Ask Me If I Care; Tough Love for the Kinky 
  description: <p>Created in response to the informal (and often impromptu) Q&A sessions after readings, this is an interactive opportunity to talk with the author of the Marketplace series and The Killer Wore Leather.  Ask anything. Kinky queries, philosophy, books, writing & publishing, fantasies, Jewish holidays - anything. Relationship issues? Ask away. But don’t expect sugar-coated answers - this can be Tough Love for the Kinky. Dear Abby can take a hike; Laura may not care, but she respects the community enough to tell the truth formed of 30 freaking years of experience and far too many confessions. Questions may be taken in advance, asked in person or even submitted anonymously at this discussion.</p>

- title: Service with a Smile - Tactics for Overcoming Temporary Obstacles in Being Your Best
  description: <p>Service is a way to demonstrate admiration, caring, respect, affection, and of course, love. It can also be a reward in and of itself, but that only goes so far. Fantasies, intentions, promises and expectations are all tested by real-world human behavior - and sometimes, it's just going to be a bitch to handle. Bad moods, faulty communication, illness, unexpected consequences and stress of all kinds will poke even the best of servants and wreck havoc with any relationship. Laura will discuss strategies in overcoming temporary distractions that keep a service-oriented individual from performing their best. Also addressed are questions of basic needs in a relationship, and ways of determining, for yourself, if the relationship you are in is positive or negative, whether you have temporary difficulties, or consistent ones. Workshop participants are encouraged to share ways they have discovered to keep a proper service mentality, and to being up the challenges of being servile - without hurting themselves or allowing harm from another.</p><p><b>NOTE</b> - To encourage honesty and open communication, this workshop is limited to those individuals providing service, rather than managing or receiving service.</p>

- title: Transparent D/s - From Projection to Reflection
  description: <p>Because, as the Talmud teaches, “We don’t see things as they are, we see things as we are,” relationships of all types are often rife with projection. If such projection goes unrecognized and unaddressed, then alienation, isolation and, ultimately, dissolution of the relationship is the result. In the case of an D/s relationship, the submissive projects his or her ideas, feelings and attitudes regarding authority figures onto the Dominant, and if that projection includes anger, fear, blame or guilt, the toll it takes on both the relationship and the Dominant’s self-esteem can be tremendous. In this enlightening presentation Master Skip will explore the underlying psycho-spiritual dynamics that make it possible for a Dominant to stand in the middle of a submissive’s projection without moving, neither accepting the projection nor rejecting it and, in doing so, facilitate the submissive’s awareness of the projection, the Dominant’s strengthened sense of competency and the realization of the true nature of the relationship for them both.</p>

- title: D/s Ethics and Expectations - The Value of a Personal Code
  description: <p>Because D/s relationships are arguably more intentional in their construct than their “vanilla” counterparts, having advance knowledge of where you and your Dominant/submissive stand on the fundamental, practical and ethical issues facing your relationship should be a given. Yet how many of us, when confronted with challenging situations and circumstances, have been shocked to discover that not only were we ignorant of our Dom’s or sub’s POV on a particular matter, we didn’t know how we ourselves felt until we were in the thick of it? Avoiding such potentially damaging surprises is just one of the many benefits of a personal code, and in this highly-interactive presentation Master Skip will explore the necessity and value of a personal code for both Dominants and submissives, offer some tips on how to craft such a code, and then provide both time and opportunity for you to begin the crafting process for yourself.</p>
