Besides enjoying the naughty, forbidden, and sexual in SM play, he finds SM to be spiritual and artistic. The body is an amazing canvas for bruises and marks; and needles can be used to create intricate designs. He loves those moments in play where everything else fades except the person with whom he is playing and the connection they have established. He especially enjoys the connection that is created when he is given the gift of submission. As Great Lakes Leather Sir 2008, he was first runner-up at ILS/b 2008.</p>
