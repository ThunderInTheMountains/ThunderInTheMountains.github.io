- title: Bare Bones Bondage 
  description: <p>In this class Lizard will teach a series of simple and efficient ties designed to restrain, contort, and torture. These ties are both easy for the top and challenging for the bottom. Most of these can be done with one (sometimes, two) lengths of rope, and with practice, can be done in under two minutes for each tie. For beginners, that means you will spend less time reviewing the steps of a takate kote on youtube, and more time spent connecting with your partner. These ties make great scene starters, whether you’re doing rope for the sake of rope, or using restraint as a means to do sensation play, impact play, sex play, etc.</p><p>To participate you will need to bring 2 lengths of natural fiber rope (7-8 meters each), an emergency rope cutting tool, suspension hardware (optional), and note taking supplies (optional).</p>

Attendees who are tying may find it helpful to have some experience with freeform rope bondage and rope handling but it is certainly not necessary.</p><p>To participate you will need to bring 1-2 lengths of 3-6mm diameter ropes (7-8 meters each in length), emergency rope cutting tool, a scarf or pillowcase (optional), note taking supplies (optional)</p>

  description: <p>After a brief overview of the male anatomy, Mr. Dawson will discuss with you the various ways that your family jewels can be put in peril.  Threats of castration, bondage, attachment, torment and torture all come to mind as possibilities.
