				<h2>Master Skip Chasey</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Skip Chasey, a/k/a Master Skip, addressed a crowd of nearly one million people at the Millennium March on Washington, and since then he has given more than a dozen keynote addresses and presented over 250 programs on the spiritual dynamics of BDSM at noteworthy leather events throughout North America.  He has been profiled in Nerve.com magazine, Power Exchange magazine, the award-winning documentary film Pup, and Ask the Man Who Owns him, slave david stein’s book on gay male Master/slave relationships that received the National Leather Association’s 2010 non-fiction literary award.  Master Skip is a co-founder of People of Leather Among You (a social and educational group for Southern California men and women interested in the integration of spirituality and leather/fetish sexuality), served as a core instructor for the Butchmanns Experience (a periodic weekend retreat offering opportunities for profound personal growth to leathermen and women of all sexual orientations and identities) and for seven years was a co-producer of Southwest Leather Conference (“The Leather Family Gathering of Heart and Spirit”).  Honors include the Leadership Award and the Lee Montague Memorial Community Service Award from Avatar Club Los Angeles, the Pantheon of Leather Community Choice Award, both the Master Heart Award and the Master Jack McGeorge Excellence in Education Award from the Master/slave Conference, and the Leatherman’s Heart Award from SWLC.  Most recently Master Skip and his slave Rick were honored to receive the 2017 Guy Baldwin Master/slave Heritage Award from the M/sC.</p><p>In his own words, “Blood may be thicker than water, but leather is thicker than blood.”</p>

					<h3>Cathartic Flogging - Merging the Erotic and the Ecstatic</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Webster’s defines catharsis as “an emotional purification or purgation that brings about spiritual renewal.” Catharsis provides release from tension, an increased feeling of aliveness, and can even serve as a catalyst for spiritual enlightenment. Through catharsis one can experience bliss. Provided that the proper intention, focus and egoic surrender are in place, the mindful use of a flogger provides an excellent opportunity for catharsis for both the Dom and the sub. Come discover the simple message of the flogger, and how that message can transform you…body, mind and spirit!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on flogging technique, but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice to facilitate catharsis.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Thunder Kiss - Love and Fear and the Single-Tail Whip</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Who hasn’t been both attracted to—and frightened by—the crack of a single tail whip as it meets its intended target? In recent years there has been a surge of interest in single tail scenes, but the tremendous exponential function of force to sensation, not to mention the potential for serious injury, requires a learned proficiency and a disciplined focus in order to safely use such a whip on another human being. Equally important is a conscious understanding of the psycho-spiritual dynamics inherent in this intense percussive practice. In this third in a series of “Shamanic SM” presentations, Master Skip will explore those dynamics and reveal the possibility for transcendence they offer. Come discover how the mindful use of a single tail can facilitate a profound spiritual awakening, no matter which end of the whip you’re on!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on single tail technique but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice as a tool for Self-realization.</p>

				<h2>Sir Rob Davidson</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Sir Rob discovered BDSM at ~7 while watching classic Star Trek. He began earnestly exploring Leather in Seattle at 21 under the guidance of Leather Daddy Dave Lewis. He now lives in Chicago, where he is the membership chair of the renowned gay men’s BDSM club, the Chicago Hellfire Club, which he has been a member of since 2003. He specializes in impact play (punching, spanking, caning, flogging, paddling), nipple torture, fisting, and play piercings. He also enjoys a little CBT and breath control added to the mix. Besides enjoying the naughty, forbidden, and sexual in SM play, he finds SM to be spiritual and artistic. The body is an amazing canvas for bruises and marks; and needles can be used to create intricate designs. He loves those moments in play where everything else fades except the person with whom he is playing and the connection they have established. He especially enjoys the connection that is created when he is given the gift of submission. As Great Lakes Leather Sir 2008, he was first runner-up at ILS/b 2008.</p>

					<h3>Impact Play When You Didn't Bring Your Toy Box</h3>
					<p>
					<p>The two most important toys are the ones you bring with you everywhere – your hands. Toys are lots of fun, but play opportunities some times happen when we aren’t expecting them or when we can’t readily get to our toys. Yet, you need to make that play happen. So, what to do? Be creative with those hands. There are many different ways the hands can be used to hit the body and its various parts. The intensity can go from delicate to mild to extreme. We will explore a variety of ways to use the hands (and arms and other body parts) for impact play. We may also explore using the hands to inflict gentle sensations to intense pain beyond the realm of impact.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Topping With Empathy - Getting Beyond Technique</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Most BDSM classes focus on equipment and technical skills – e.g., where to hit when flogging, how to prep for play piercing, different implements to use in impact play. They may include a description of how a technique might feel to the bottom – e.g. white pain, thuddy, stingy. However, even if you have experienced that scene as a bottom, your bottom may be having a very different experience than you did or than the last bottom you had the same scene with. How do you tune into your bottom, read all the messages they are giving you (verbal and non-verbal), so that you can both have an experience that leaves you satisfied and ready for another play date? We will look at how to read your bottom’s body and moans. We will examine communicating throughout a scene with various levels of directness and subtlety. We will also work on trying to develop a mind set of being able to have a foot in what our play partner is experiencing while maintaining our own top/dominant role. </p>

					<h3>Reclaiming our Pleasure Rights - Exploring Sexuality for Trans* Folk and their Lovers</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Let’s skip to the meat of the matter - we want sex, we have sex, and we deserve sex. But how can we reclaim our pleasure rights when we won’t even talk about it with our friends and lovers? In this class we will dive into the fears we have around rejection and body dysphoria, then put that all on a shelf for a few minutes to dive into what actually WORKS! How does humor and joy play into our pursuit of pleasure? What issues face trans* folks or others who are outside the binary who have male partners, female partners, trans* partners, and hell, what do you call the stuff between your legs anyway? Does it matter? We’ll touch on the issues of safer sex as well, in a community where our desperation to be touched the way we need to be touched has led to a heartbreaking habit of doing anything to get our needs met. Breathe deep, and get ready to listen from your heart and share from your spirit.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Service That Actually Serves US - Giving and Receiving What WE Really Want</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Are you sick of being asked to scrub the toilet as if your partner expects you to cum each time you do it for them? Does having your Submissive shave their balls three times a day actually help you live a full and fulfilling life? Let’s get down and dirty – talking about and working through exercises on establishing what service we really want, what we are able to give, and what drives us in service from all sides. Is it about effort, quality of outcome, detailed delivery, results, our resources expended… or getting hard/wet? Service is not just provided by Slaves and Submissive or Surrendering individuals – Masters, Mistresses, Mommies, Daddies, Boys, Girls, Lovers, and Friends will also get a chance to look at their desires and see what actually gets them what they actually desire.</p>

					<h3>Sadistic Floor Ties</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Do you want to hurt your bottom with rope, contort the body, torture little-known places, and hear lovely squeals of pain (and pleasure)? All you need to know for this class is a single-column tie, and you can create beautiful (and painful) bondage and predicaments on the ground. No fancy knots or harnesses needed! Bring your enthusiasm and your creativity, and we will explore a number of different tricks and techniques to create an incredible rope experience for both top and bottom!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Responsible Bottoming for Everyone</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Contrary to what it may sometimes seem, bottoms are not just interchangeable bodies whose only responsibilities are listing limits, taking pain and safe wording. A great bottom can help a top get more out of a scene, elevate a scene from good to great, and even open the door to edgier types of play.</p><p>honey will begin by discussing what can make an experience a great one for both the top and the bottom, and what you can do to enhance the experience, even if you're not the one throwing rope or a whip. We'll move on to talk about types of effective negotiation and communication during scenes, as well as ways to protect yourself and what to do if things go awry. We will examine everything from light pickup play to safely exploring heavier and edgier play, and various types of consent models. Regardless of what you're interested in, honey will help you to be a more informed partner, as well as to develop the tools you need in order to foster an amazing scene--from the bottom!</p>

				<h2>Levi "Otter"</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Levi "Otter" hails from Denver where he proudly represents his state as Mr Leather Colorado 2011. His adventure into the leather and kink community started as a young boy when he was given his first pair of boots and taught how to care for leather gear. That experience taught him not only invaluable skills as a bootblack but also the importance of education passed down to the next generation. While teaching at events he is regularly accompanied by his two pups Sprocket and Tai. Their poly family affectionately named Otter Nonsense has made it a mission of theirs to be a loud voice for diversity, supporting our various communities, and the safety that comes from not just education but the celebration of all people and critters as equals in beauty and voice.</p>

					<h3>Just the Basics</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Covering the basics in rope bondage is particularly important.  This class not only tells you where to start, but we dive in and get our hands on each other.  Rope is not just a tool or a kink, but it is a mindset that is only confined by your imagination and willingness to explore.  You will leave this class with a few basic ties and insight into how to think rope not just tie it.  Bring your own rope, 6-8 lengths of rope.  Otter suggests 25-35 foot lengths of any of your bondage rope you like.  Also bring someone to tie on because this isn’t just a lecture.  It’s a hands-on lab setting!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Aw Christfuck!</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Religion is often a taboo subject, especially at the dinner table...  In his class Otter approaches religion and race with pure irreverence.  When diving into such taboo subjects profound experiences are guaranteed to happen so strap on your boots and leave the delicate sensitivities at the door.  This class will explore how to choose the proper play space, involving others in tertiary roles, using sacred symbols and language to evoke emotions, ways to create a ritual or religious experience through kink, and the potential catharsis and aftercare.  It cannot be stressed enough this class is not for the faint of heart...most belief systems will be discussed in reverent and irreverent ways that may be offensive to some people but entirely titillating to the rest of us.</p>

				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.stefanosandshay.com" target="_blank">Stefanos and Shay</a></h3>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Stefanos & Shay (StefanosandShay.com) are a vivacious, unconventional D/s couple whose entertaining, information-packed classes have been called "better than a Vegas act.” They identify as pansexual polyamorous playsluts, purveyors of perversion, and alliteration fetishists! They are based in San Francisco, where they host over 60 events a year (including <a href="www.twistedwindows.com/" target="_blank">BENT, Twisted Windows, Master’s Den, Self-Suspension Open Space</a>, & <a href="www.bondage-a-go-go.com/" target="_blank">Bondage-a-Go-Go</a>) and were named King & Queen of Pervert's Prom in 2006!<p>Shay is a medical professional by day, education director for <a href="www.darkodyssey.com/" target="_blank">Dark Odyssey - Surrender</a> and writer/creator of bondage safety repository <a href="www.RemedialRopes.com" target="_blank">www.RemedialRopes.com</a> by night, as well as a prominent <a href="www.selfsuspend.com/" target="_blank">self-suspender</a> known for unique, dynamic rigs and prodigious performances. Stefanos is all kink all the time as DM & CEO of Bondage-a-Go-Go, event manager at the <a href="www.sfcitadel.org/" target="_blank">SF Citadel</a>, and Producer/Steward of The Upper Floor on Kink.com. Together they have performed, presented, and hosted around the country and internationally.</p>

					<h3>It's a Trap - Playful Scenes & Non-Bondage Predicaments</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This isn’t always serious work we do! Predicaments are all about putting your bottom between the proverbial rock and hard place (and laughing as they are flummoxed by their situation) - playful BDSM is about giggling together in scene and making your bottom participate in their own torment.</p><p>This class will show you how to bring a new level of engagement to your BDSM play and go beyond giving and receiving sensations – create story lines and connect mentally with your partner. Stefanos & Shay will also address the bottom’s perspective, including communicating within the “mood” of your scene and detailed discussion of “bratting.”</p><p>Leave your rope bag at home – this is NOT a bondage class! In addition to demonstrating many specific predicaments and “games,” Stefanos & Shay will discuss this type of play in a broad sense to guide you in developing your own unique scenes.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Skin Deep - Cutting for Play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>There is nothing quite like the sensation of a cutting – the fear, as you see and feel a blade against your skin, the sharp, immediate pain as the cut is made, the slow tingle and wet feeling of blood dripping down your skin.</p><p>In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate surface cuttings using sterile scalpels, including information on both freehand and patterned cuttings using transfer paper. While they teach – and preach! – that you should always go into a cutting assuming it will scar, their focus in this class is to partake in cuttings as play (as opposed to cuttings as body modification) while seeking to minimize scars. There will be a focus on RACK and making cuttings as safe (with discussion by Shay, a medical professional) and sexy as possible.</p><p>While the technical information is a crucial starting point, this class will go beyond the basics, discussing cutting as spiritual play and working within a D/s dynamic. This is an advanced edge play topic. </p>

					<h3>Strong Slaves, Bodacious Bottoms & Ass-Kicking Submissives - Embracing Dichotomy</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Self-identification is difficult for anyone in the alternative lifestyle. It can be even more challenging for people who see themselves as strong in their lives but desirous of submission. There is a great deal of pressure in the BDSM community to “seem submissive,” so what do you do when you see yourself as strong and fierce and yet crave mastery and domination?</p><p>Believe me, you are not alone. There are many submissives and bottoms and slaves who are strong and independent and finding their way through the maze of the Kink Community! This class is an intense discussion of self-assessment personal identification, passion and power. From those who struggle with their desire to submit, to those who strive for greater strength of purpose, this class will be a wonderful opportunity to bond with the like-minded and suss out your strength in an open setting. And for tops dominants and masters, this is an excellent opportunity to get into the mind of those who are strong and embrace the dichotomy of strength in submission and freedom in slavery!</p>

					<h3>Taboo Play, and Working Through Extremes</h3>
					<p>
					<p>If you have ever had a scene that lured you with the promise of edgy intensity, but wondered if you could handle the situation before, during or afterward, this discussion is for you! We will explore the reasons some people enjoy play that is VERY edgy psychologically, emotionally and physically, and how you can go about making that fantasy a reality. Inherent in this discussion is the level of responsibility of both / all partners, how to manage risk, and how you can support your partner in the aftermath. Edgy play can be hot, and we will look at ways to avoid some common pitfalls, as well as how to recover with grace and honor when things go off of the planned path.</p><p>*Please be advised - Some highly controversial scenes (i.e. racial or incest play, weaponry, etc.) will be discussed. Please do not attend if these are outside of your comfort zone. Thank you.</p>
