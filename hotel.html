<p>Credit cards will be charged one night charge at the time of the reservation, the remaining nights will be charged on check out. You will be required to have a <b>two night minimum stay on Friday and Saturday night</b>.  Also please NOTE that if you wish to book multiple rooms you will need to contact Brian at <a href="mailto:brian@thunderinthemountains.com">brian@thunderinthemountains.com</a> for approval.  The hotel will contact you first if the charge does not go through before canceling a reservation.  If you wish to cancel your reservation you MUST do so before July 1, 2018, or you will be charged for one room night even if you do not attend.

So, reserve your rooms early, but if you don’t think you can attend, be sure and cancel them before July 1, 2018 to prevent an unwanted charge to your card.
