  bio: <p>Scott Smith grew up in the Northwest and began exploring the facets of S&M at an early age. With his creative and rather deviant mind, he enthusiastically developed his techniques of bondage and suspension from his experience with nautical and high angle rope work. The powerful physical interactions that became the hallmark of his S&M activities were initially necessities for various activities including white water rafting, scuba, climbing, and paramedical rescue.</p><p>Scott brings a distinct intensity and passion to the ebb and flow of learning, teaching and actualizing S&M. A believer that the magic of BDSM comes through the connection of the participants, his workshops develop and nurture that connection; while maintaining a decidedly sadistic edginess.</p><p>Starting in the early 90's, Scott has presented countless workshops and seminars throughout North America and abroad for organizations large and small. Scott is internationally known for his rope work, connection, and edge play workshops.</p><p>Having received a number of awards, Scott is incredibly honored to be a recipient of the Chicago Hellfire Club’s Caligula award.</p><p>Scott may be contacted through his email - <a href="mailto:Connect@OneWithKnots.com?subject=Questions">Connect@OneWithKnots.com</a> or his web site - <a href="http://www.OneWithKnots.com" target="_blank">www.OneWithKnots.com</a></p>
