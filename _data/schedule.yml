- title: Service with a Smile - Tactics for Overcoming Temporary Obstacles in Being Your Best
  description: <p>Service is a way to demonstrate admiration, caring, respect, affection, and of course, love. It can also be a reward in and of itself, either as a pleasurable thing the bottom really enjoys doing, or an experience the bottom wishes to have for a personal reason. Some people enter service specifically to have the experience on their way toward becoming a more well rounded practitioner of SM. But again and again, we return to what they most basically want to do, and to be useful. Attending “Service-oriented Submission” is not required, but highly recommended. Laura will discuss strategies in overcoming those temporary distractions that keep a service-oriented individual from performing their best. Also addressed are questions of basic needs in a relationship, and ways of determining, for yourself, if the relationship you are in is positive or negative, whether you have temporary difficulties, or consistent ones. Workshop participants are encouraged to share ways they have discovered to keep a proper service mentality, and to being up the challenges of being servile.</p><p>To encourage honesty and open communication, this workshop should limited to those individuals providing service, rather than managing or receiving service. If that's not possible, the class can be taught, but it's better to limit the attendance to encourage discussion and honesty.</p>

  description: <p>A true dominant will never bottom. We're all safe, sane and consensual. Kinky people are smarter & more creative. Safewords are necessary. Verbs are nouns. There are no rules. There are rules. How many times have you heard people state, with authority and assurance, something that sounds absolute and yet maybe a little fishy? How many times have you passed on a fact or truth or rule you secretly question, or realized much later that you had been misinformed? For a scene supposedly based on open and honest communication (hah!) we tell each other – and sometimes ourselves – a lot of things that ain't necessarily so. Whether you are new and soaking it up like a sponge or an old hand and ready to speak truth to kink, come on in for a look at some of the top deceptions, inventions and whoppers we pass around!</p>

If this has peeked your curiosity, this may be the class for you. Simon will go over the primary "word prisons" that we and others around us impose upon each other and some ways we can break out of those word prisons.</p><p><b>WARNING - This is an intense class that will change your life forever.</b></p><p>As one past attendee wrote a few months after the class, "After your class, I escaped the four main word prisons, and I now have a whole new set of friends who don't want to lock me up into what they expect me to be for them! I wake up smiling now. I even love myself a little more and find myself getting excited about all the possibilities that were once stored away in my head labeled as unattainable fantasies.

- title: Landmines
  description: In kink and BDSM, we all bring a certain amount of 'baggage' to the table. And some of us even bring freight!   While these are elements of what makes us all human, they can become a critical issue when it comes to the intensity of the power exchange that exists in a kink relationship. A LANDMINE refers to what happens when a negative element of our past gets triggered during the course of that relationship, be it in play or otherwise. In this class Master Dart will facilitate a discussion about some of the possible landmines that can come up in the course of a D/s relationship or playscene, and how we can deal their accidental detonation and grow from them.

  description: <p>Autoscopy is defined as “looking back at one's own body from a vantage point or position outside of the physical body”.   Cases of it have been attributed to everything from delirium and psychosis to astral projection and life after death.   Autoscopy is also associated with seeing one's double or a duplicate of one's own body. In this seminar Eibon will use video glasses and cameras to simulate autoscopic experiences within BDSM scenes, adding another new and exciting dimension to a type of play that is just now catching on around the country.   Everything from candle wax to terror play becomes more intense while the bottom is "outside his/her own body witnessing it.”</p><p>Uncle Abdul, author of “Juice - Electricity for Pleasure and Pain” writes -"Autoscopy with the use of video glasses as demonstrated in Eibon's class is the most innovative contribution to BDSM play since the invention of the whip."</p><p>"Seeing the equipment in person made me realize just how mind fucking an experience this could be.   This is an amazing insight on your part Eibon, into a completely new realm of exploration.  I'm looking forward to trying them again.   The possibilities seem endless with your set up!

  description: Do you find Dexter's kill room to be scary and erotic? Have you gotten aroused by war crimes depicted in a documentary? This is dark, potentially dangerous stuff to play with, but in this class as a small group we will explore these feelings with an emphasis on bringing those fantasies to life in a safe and risk- aware manner. We will dissect several examples of realistic, potentially criminal activities with the purpose of figuring out how to safely enact a fantasy version of those. Many of these examples use restraints less commonly found in kink which each carry their own risks.  In order to decrease the risk we will discuss, demonstrate, and use specific means of restraint and destruction.  If you have ever found yourself fixating on some of the darker aspects of real-life crimes and you have craved some sort of guidance to play safely in these realms, this is a class you won't want to miss!

Surrender by the person being interrogated, in the end, will be the choice of his own free will.</p><p>Interrogation play in many ways starts where the traditional BDSM scene stops. The power, intensity and focus of this form of play are intended to be both psychologically and emotionally overwhelming.  By definition It can push the limits of physical, emotional and psychological endurance. The question in a scene like this is - How can we do that while safeguarding the well-being of the bottom?</p><p>In this presentation Eric will discuss and demonstrate how interrogation can be done in a safe and consensual way where excitement can be intense but no damage is done. Indeed, it can be a very hot form of play!  If you are one of those edgy players who loves the quaisi-abusive dynamic of real interrogation, then this is a class you simply cannot afford to miss!</p>

Bottoming skills are frequently overlooked, but any top who’s had the pleasure of playing with a truly dynamic bottom will agree that they are they are the skillziest skillz in BDSM! Whether your dynamic is brat play or high protocol Master/slave, there are verbal and non-verbal methods you can use during the scene to give feedback and guidance to ultimately make a more satisfying experience for yourself AND your top. In addition to the focus on in-scene communication, this class will include interactive activities to help you approach tops for play, discussion about negotiation (hint - it isn’t just passively being interrogated by the top!), and tips on taking care of yourself before & after a scene.

This would   include the likes of Daddy/boy or girl, Dom/sub and Master/slave dynamics.    Master Taino will discuss all the misconceptions and fears many people have upon entering this type of relationship.   This discussion is excellent for Leather folks and BDSM practitioners who want to take their kink and BDSM practices beyond the bed and the dungeon and into everyday life by forming healthy power-exchange or authority-based relationships.   This is especially true when they are not sure what it all entails or how to get started.   Questions and discussion are encouraged.
