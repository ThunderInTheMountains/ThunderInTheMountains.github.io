				<p>Laura Antoniou is the author of the well known Marketplace series of erotic novels, but has also written dozens of short stories, essays and other works in various genres for over 25 years. Winner of the NLA & the Pantheon of Leather Lifetime Achievement Awards and the Jack McGeorge Excellence in Education Award, she has presented, taught and ranted at over 150 conferences and events since the early 80's, delivering enlightenment, entertainment and indictments.

Over the years, her work has been translated into Spanish, German, Japanese and Hebrew.  In 2010, she hit the world of e-books as the Marketplace moved to Circlet Press, and Laura came out as Christopher Morgan, best-selling writer of gay male erotica, including the novel Musclebound. Together with her wife, Karen Taylor, she has written a ritually correct leather Passover seder, titled Avadim Chayanu, available for free upon asking. All of her other available works can be found listed at her website, <a href="http://www.lantoniou.com" target="_blank">lantoniou.com</a></p><p>Laura is personally featured in Writing Below the Belt; Conversations with Erotic Authors, by Michael Rowe, and The Burning Pen; Sex Writers on Sex Writing, by M.

					<h3>Service with a Smile - Tactics for Overcoming Temporary Obstacles in Being Your Best</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Service is a way to demonstrate admiration, caring, respect, affection, and of course, love. It can also be a reward in and of itself, either as a pleasurable thing the bottom really enjoys doing, or an experience the bottom wishes to have for a personal reason. Some people enter service specifically to have the experience on their way toward becoming a more well rounded practitioner of SM. But again and again, we return to what they most basically want to do, and to be useful. Attending “Service-oriented Submission” is not required, but highly recommended. Laura will discuss strategies in overcoming those temporary distractions that keep a service-oriented individual from performing their best. Also addressed are questions of basic needs in a relationship, and ways of determining, for yourself, if the relationship you are in is positive or negative, whether you have temporary difficulties, or consistent ones. Workshop participants are encouraged to share ways they have discovered to keep a proper service mentality, and to being up the challenges of being servile.</p><p>To encourage honesty and open communication, this workshop should limited to those individuals providing service, rather than managing or receiving service. If that's not possible, the class can be taught, but it's better to limit the attendance to encourage discussion and honesty.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>That Ain't Necessarily So – Lies, Exaggerations & Silly Shit You Keep Hearing In the Scene</h3>
					<p>
					<p>A true dominant will never bottom. We're all safe, sane and consensual. Kinky people are smarter & more creative. Safewords are necessary. Verbs are nouns. There are no rules. There are rules. How many times have you heard people state, with authority and assurance, something that sounds absolute and yet maybe a little fishy? How many times have you passed on a fact or truth or rule you secretly question, or realized much later that you had been misinformed? For a scene supposedly based on open and honest communication (hah!) we tell each other – and sometimes ourselves – a lot of things that ain't necessarily so. Whether you are new and soaking it up like a sponge or an old hand and ready to speak truth to kink, come on in for a look at some of the top deceptions, inventions and whoppers we pass around!</p>

				<h2>Simon Blaise</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				Since his introduction into the BDSM lifestyle in the early 90s, the "Kinkstar" Simon Blaise has shared his passion for BDSM with the world as an international presenter at BDSM/Leather events across the globe for the last 9 years. As an attorney, he has provided pro bono legal services to members of the BDSM, Leather and LGBTQ communities for the last 10 years. As an intersex transgender person with multiple personalities, who was born both genders and lives equally as both a male and a female, he hopes to pave the way for others in our community to feel more comfortable about living authentically and openly. Simon's ultimate goal is to be a part of helping society see BDSM as a beautiful and rewarding subculture that deserves all the legal protections afforded to other minorities.   Recently, Simon Blaise, along with his soul sister Alexandria Blaise, were given the distinct honor and privilege to serve as Rocky Mountain Person of Leather 2014.   Simon has revolutionized fire play with his innovation of fire torches he calls, Blaise Sticks that allow for longer burn times (approx. 15 min), safer fueling techniques, and less refueling, which means more fire play. He is also responsible for the introduction of his Blaise Wrap Suspension technique to the kink community, bringing a whole new dimension to suspension while providing a much safer alternative to rope suspension. Simon's latest innovation, Blaise Floggers, provides a safer alternative to "fire flogging" that actually gives the bottom the sensation of both leather and fire simultaneously.   Simon teaches courses on fire play with Blaise Sticks, polyvinyl suspensions using the Blaise Wrap technique, flogging, canning, single tail, violet wands, M/s relationships, improving one's scene with connection and spirituality, and much more.

					<h3>Own Your Kink</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Have you ever fantasized what it would be like to have the ability to live your life on your own terms without caring what other people think? What if others had no choice but to accept you for who you truly and essentially are? Would you let your full true self out of its cage? If this has peeked your curiosity, this may be the class for you. Simon will go over the primary "word prisons" that we and others around us impose upon each other and some ways we can break out of those word prisons.</p><p><b>WARNING - This is an intense class that will change your life forever.</b></p><p>As one past attendee wrote a few months after the class, "After your class, I escaped the four main word prisons, and I now have a whole new set of friends who don't want to lock me up into what they expect me to be for them! I wake up smiling now. I even love myself a little more and find myself getting excited about all the possibilities that were once stored away in my head labeled as unattainable fantasies. I only wish I had attended your class 10 years ago."</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Bringing Spirituality & Connection into Your Scene</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This class is an opportunity to start you on a path towards learning how to connect with yourself, the implements you use during play, and the person you play with. The class includes both a discussion and an interactive workshop for those who wish to bring their favorite toy and play partner for a guided hands-on workshop that will move you away from being a mere impact player and towards being a kinkysexual human being who creates moments to be remembered for a lifetime.</p><p><b>WARNING - This is an intense class and it will change your life forever.</B></p><p>As one previous attendee wrote "I strongly feel you should give a warning that if they are not ready for an intense scene in addition to seeing their relationship naked with all of its beauty and imperfections for the first time, then they are in the wrong class."</p>

				<h2>Dart</h2>
				
				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.sirdart.com" target="_blank">Dart's Domain</a></h3>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				Master Dart's interest in leather and BDSM play can be traced as far back as his early childhood years, citing a huge fascination with what was being done to Robin on the “Batman” television series…and to the furry cowboys on “Gunsmoke.” When other boys were caught with porn magazines under their beds…Dart was caught with a roll of duct tape. Since then he has developed an immense passion for rope bondage, not to mention the men he likes to tie up with it. Dart began his leather journey as a collared boy and gradually developed into the dominant he is today. He believes in the importance of “balance” when exploring one’s dominant and submissive side in play, and that great benefit can come from experiencing both elements. Master Dart’s kinky interests in addition to rope bondage include puppy play and training, chest and gut punching, and most recently, fire play. He sees himself as "proudly New Guard" because he feels that what is most important is not what happened in the past but what is happening NOW, and that our sexual self-expression should not be hindered by rigid or judgmental 'rules' from our past.  Among the cities, organizations and events Dart has presented in include sitting on the educational board for “Mr. Leatherman Toronto,”  “Spring Iniquity” in Houston, “Thunder in the Mountains” in Denver,  “GEAR Ireland” in Dublin,  “Leather Pride” in Amsterdam, and the “Rome BDSM Conference.”   He also hosts his own leather podcast program on ITunes, called “Dart’s Domain.” He shares his life with his husband Sir Bart. They reside in Virginia Beach, VA.

					<h3>Landmines</h3>
					<p>
					In kink and BDSM, we all bring a certain amount of 'baggage' to the table. And some of us even bring freight!   While these are elements of what makes us all human, they can become a critical issue when it comes to the intensity of the power exchange that exists in a kink relationship. A LANDMINE refers to what happens when a negative element of our past gets triggered during the course of that relationship, be it in play or otherwise. In this class Master Dart will facilitate a discussion about some of the possible landmines that can come up in the course of a D/s relationship or playscene, and how we can deal their accidental detonation and grow from them.
					</p>
				
					<h3>Puppy Love</h3>
					<p>
					ARF ARF!! Embrace your inner canine!  These are sounds that you will likely hear more and more inside and outside of kinky play scenes around America and the world.  In this workshop and demonstration Dart will cover the fundamental aspects and safety issues surrounding this rapidly growing phenomenon of puppy play. Dart’s demonstration will show both handlers and future “pups” the playful elements and the psychology in this fun and popular form of play. If you have been interesting in exploring the canine within you and/or your sub, and you want to attend this highly informative class, you should wear comfortable clothing and be prepared to “move” as Dart has you exploring this high-energy and transformational power exchange!

				<h2>Eibon</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>After spending several years living in Europe while serving in the US military Eibon returned to the States and began an informal study of the dark side of the mind, which consisted of everything from managing "Mystery" of VH1's "The Pickup Artist" fame to studying the linguistic stylings of Charles Manson.  A late-night encounter with a young woman he met online in late 2005 piqued his curiosity about BDSM.   In 2006 he officially entered the scene, and by late 2007 he had purchased his first electrical gear and was off and running, giving demonstrations shortly thereafter.</p><p>Known for bearing a sadistic grin and being frequently accused of "evil," he is a member of the Society of Janus, a Founder of the Boise BDSM Society, creator of the "Idaho BDSM" group on FetLife, administrator of <a href="http://IdahoBDSM.com" target="_blank">IdahoBDSM.com</a>, and a writer of published articles in “SECRET Magazine” from Belgium.  He also appeared in shadow to talk about the lifestyle with Boise CBS affiliate KBOI-2 for their "A Little 50 Shades - Boise Style" feature in May 2013.   His presentations range from the serious to the absurd, and often reflecting the energy of his audience.</p><p>One attendee said of him - "You have an intensity that keeps me glued to my seat and forgetting to breathe."  Let’s hope this attendee doesn’t suffocate.</p>

					<h3>Video Glasses / Autoscopy</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Autoscopy is defined as “looking back at one's own body from a vantage point or position outside of the physical body”.   Cases of it have been attributed to everything from delirium and psychosis to astral projection and life after death.   Autoscopy is also associated with seeing one's double or a duplicate of one's own body. In this seminar Eibon will use video glasses and cameras to simulate autoscopic experiences within BDSM scenes, adding another new and exciting dimension to a type of play that is just now catching on around the country.   Everything from candle wax to terror play becomes more intense while the bottom is "outside his/her own body witnessing it.”</p><p>Uncle Abdul, author of “Juice - Electricity for Pleasure and Pain” writes -"Autoscopy with the use of video glasses as demonstrated in Eibon's class is the most innovative contribution to BDSM play since the invention of the whip."</p><p>"Seeing the equipment in person made me realize just how mind fucking an experience this could be.   This is an amazing insight on your part Eibon, into a completely new realm of exploration.  I'm looking forward to trying them again.   The possibilities seem endless with your set up! Simply genius!”---Libertine</p><p>In 2011 "Watch Yourself - BDSM with Video Glasses" was featured in SECRET Magazine
					</p>
				
					<h3>High-end Electrical Play - Light, Sound, Massage, Electricity</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Eibon takes electrical play to the next level by combining light, sound, massage, and electricity to create a completely immersive, human experience.</p><p>In order to achieve this brilliant scene Eibon utilizes an ErosTek 312 e-stim unit in conjunction with a Nova Pro 100 light/sound machine.  In addition he adds a Homedics massage seat and syncs all three to music.   One class participant commented -</p><p>"Eibon's electrical play is fucking amazing.   Lights, massage, current inside my pussy, and all of it set to music.   He said it would take me to another orbit... um... hell yeah!   I need to visit Boise again soon!"</p><p>Another class volunteer in Hollywood commented - "I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed meeting you and how happy I am that I responded to your post!   What an incredible experience it was... more and better than I could possibly have imagined.   You were wonderful, and I don't know how to say a proper thank you.   I feel so lucky."</p><p>No prior experience with electrical play is required to enjoy the class but those who are familiar with it would likely have a better appreciation for what is actually occurring as well as the technical set-up involved.</p><p>Officer Wes pioneered this type of scene, his High End Electrical handout may be viewed here - <a href="http://www.officerwes.com/electrical/power_play_high_end_electrical.htm" target="_blank">http://www.officerwes.com/electrical/power_play_high_end_electrical.htm </a></p>

					<h3>Rubberband Play</h3>
					<p>
					Rubberbands are very inexpensive but can provide numerous and exciting,  painful thrills in the areas of TT, CBT, bondage, and bruising. Welts can and do occur in rubberband scenes, but of course, this is part of the fun.  This seminar will be hands on and will concentrate on incorporating rubberbands into scenes and play for novices and advanced players alike.  In this class Mark will discuss the uses and the safety concerns or these stinging little bastards.  If you were one of those bratty kids in grade school and junior high who loved to pull back the rubber bands and snap your friends or girl friends, and if this is still an exciting prospect to you, then this is a class you really have to see.
					</p>
				
					<h3>Mummification</h3>
					<p>
					Mummification is a very popular  scene in the BDSM arena which involves the restraining a person by wrapping their body in materials such as saran wrap, bandages, tape or other numerous binding materials.  Mummification can be used as a sensory deprivation scene or used in conjunction with other activities when the body is restrained andwhere both sexual excitement and moderate pain are involved.   This workout will be a hands on demonstration. Mark discuss different methods of mummification, uses of different materials to wrap or not wrap the various parts of the body, and the health and safety concerns associated with this exciting scene.

					<h3>Choose Your Own Edge Play Adventure</h3>
					<p>
					Do you find Dexter's kill room to be scary and erotic? Have you gotten aroused by war crimes depicted in a documentary? This is dark, potentially dangerous stuff to play with, but in this class as a small group we will explore these feelings with an emphasis on bringing those fantasies to life in a safe and risk- aware manner. We will dissect several examples of realistic, potentially criminal activities with the purpose of figuring out how to safely enact a fantasy version of those. Many of these examples use restraints less commonly found in kink which each carry their own risks.  In order to decrease the risk we will discuss, demonstrate, and use specific means of restraint and destruction.  If you have ever found yourself fixating on some of the darker aspects of real-life crimes and you have craved some sort of guidance to play safely in these realms, this is a class you won't want to miss!

					<h3>Fantasy Rape Play - From Curious about to in to in one class</h3>
					<p>
					According to many surveys, one of the most popular fantasies among both gay and straight audiences is that of rape.  Through force or coercion and independent of gender, rape play can be terrifying and erotic for both the top and bottom.  In this class Frozen Meursault will take a "how-to" approach on a number of actionable teaching points for attendees to begin employing as they explore rape play in the scene. Safety issues will be stressed with an emphasis placed on recognizing risks and mitigating them to give participants a foundation upon which to build as they enter this psychologically tricky form of play. By focusing more on practical points than lofty discussions this class is an effective jumping off point for actual, hot sexual play.

					<h3>Interrogation - The Border Between Play and Reality</h3>
					<p>
					<p>The basic scenerio for any interrogation is basically centered around a particular premise - What did they know and when did they know it?   “I’m sorry...I do not recall that information.”  We have all heard such crap before, so let’s forget spin – get to the heart of the situation – and be all the better for it. Surrender by the person being interrogated, in the end, will be the choice of his own free will.</p><p>Interrogation play in many ways starts where the traditional BDSM scene stops. The power, intensity and focus of this form of play are intended to be both psychologically and emotionally overwhelming.  By definition It can push the limits of physical, emotional and psychological endurance. The question in a scene like this is - How can we do that while safeguarding the well-being of the bottom?</p><p>In this presentation Eric will discuss and demonstrate how interrogation can be done in a safe and consensual way where excitement can be intense but no damage is done. Indeed, it can be a very hot form of play!  If you are one of those edgy players who loves the quaisi-abusive dynamic of real interrogation, then this is a class you simply cannot afford to miss!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Fuck with the Mind - Changing Reality Through Head Games</h3>
					<p>
					<p>When people think of the term “mind fuck” many things come to mind….  psychological play, mind games, deception, alternating reality, playing with fear. These are all valid examples of “mind fucks”.</p><p>In this presentation Eric will take a closer look at mind fucks and will discuss and demonstrate what they are, how they’re done, when to do them, and the many associated safety concerns that must be taken into consideration when entering into this type of scene.</p><p>Beware that this is not everyone’s cup of tea. If can be intense, but if you are the type of person who gets aroused by the idea of playing with someone’s mind, then this is a class you will certainly want to attend.</p>

					<h3>Engage - Dynamic bottoming</h3>
					<p>
					Being the receptive partner doesn’t mean that your only value comes from your physical appearance, ability to take pain, or capacity to stay on your knees for hours on end. Bottoming skills are frequently overlooked, but any top who’s had the pleasure of playing with a truly dynamic bottom will agree that they are they are the skillziest skillz in BDSM! Whether your dynamic is brat play or high protocol Master/slave, there are verbal and non-verbal methods you can use during the scene to give feedback and guidance to ultimately make a more satisfying experience for yourself AND your top. In addition to the focus on in-scene communication, this class will include interactive activities to help you approach tops for play, discussion about negotiation (hint - it isn’t just passively being interrogated by the top!), and tips on taking care of yourself before & after a scene. (This class contains elements of demo, lecture, discussion, and class interaction.)
					</p>
				
					<h3>Penetrate - Advanced Play Piercing</h3>
					<p>
					Make dramatic and imaginative needle art, connect spiritually with your partner through energy work that literally gets under their skin, or just be a sadistic asshole- this class on advanced needleplay techniques will give you the tools! Depending on the interests of the attendees (which will be surveyed at the start of the session), technical skills covered may include using body jewelry and piercing needles for play, using larger gauge needles (16, 14, and bigger!), needle bondage, zippers, predicaments, using IV needles for surface piercings, crossing patterns, weaving, using suture sets, threading, genital piercing, decorative needle play, and impact play over needles… but this class is about more than technical skills, so it won’t stop there! Stefanos & Shay will also discuss types of needle play scenes, spirituality for needle play (including doing a needle pull), and execution in context. “Play piercing 101″ level knowledge & experience are required to attend this advanced-level session. Beginning play piercing techniques and safety/negotiation topics will NOT be reviewed. If you can, please bring a minimally furry stuffed animal to class with you- you will pierce your completely consenting “stunt stuffie” to practice as we go along! Supplies for in-class use (and some loaner stuffies) will be provided. (This class is demo, lecture, discussion, and hands-on- how much of each component depends on the interests of the class.)

					<h3>Living Real and Authentic Lives - The Key to Our Happiness</h3>
					<p>
					Our journey has to begin with our desire to live real and authentic lives, no matter if you are a Master or slave, or just as a kinky individual.  Often we spend way too much time trying to conform to the norms and expectations of others, and very little time listening to our heart and our spirit.  In this class, Master Taíno will detail the need of every human being to find his/her callings in life and to live accordingly.  Master Taino will also discuss the need to live our lives to the fullest in a real and authentic way without concern about the expectations or judgments of others.  He adamantly advocates that this should be the first step to have healthy Master/slave and/or Dom/sub relationships.  If you want to discover a real way to live a true and authentic life, then this class is a must-see.
					</p>
				
					<h3>Power-Exchange Relationships - Separating the Reality from the Fantasy</h3>
					<p>
					This class is a basic introduction to the world of power-exchange, authority based relationships within our Leather and BDSM culture. In this class  Master Taíno will address the huge difference between the fantasy often portrayed in videos, porno and fiction books and magazines (as well as the new “50 shades of Gray”) and the reality of living these powerful and unique alternative relationship.   This presentation offers attendees   a wide range of options that are available   for newcomers to the power exchange relationships..  This would   include the likes of Daddy/boy or girl, Dom/sub and Master/slave dynamics.    Master Taino will discuss all the misconceptions and fears many people have upon entering this type of relationship.   This discussion is excellent for Leather folks and BDSM practitioners who want to take their kink and BDSM practices beyond the bed and the dungeon and into everyday life by forming healthy power-exchange or authority-based relationships.   This is especially true when they are not sure what it all entails or how to get started.   Questions and discussion are encouraged.

				Thraje has been a member of BDSM communities for more than a decade, exploring the many facets of pansexual D/s dynamics in cities across North America, Europe and Asia. After starting from an exploration of corporal BDSM, Thraje shifted focus over the last 10 years to mental and emotional BDSM, employing values-based protocol as his primary tool.  In addition, Thraje conducted extensive primary and secondary research on D/s dynamics and protocol. He is a member of the protocol-oriented D/s House, Maison Exotique, and a member of the  larger leather community. Thraje is also the founder  of the Bay Area’s Fete-a-Fet group and various other protocol-oriented D/s events.  He has volunteered for NCSF (National Coalition for Sexual Freedom) and is an M/s participant in MAsT (Masters and slaves together). Thraje is the Master of his lovely girl, Pixelvixen as well as being a father, a successful entrepreneur, an Ironman, 12 stepper, an active youth volunteer, an animal protection activist, and an avid & grateful world traveler.

					<h3>Advanced D/s and Protocol (Part 1) – Dominant & Submissive</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In his Advanced Protocol classes, Thraje will show you how to develop your own, personalized values-based dynamic and individual protocol system. Committing to the exploration of D/s is a fantastic starting point, but deepening your D/s dynamic and making it more persistent becomes the real journey. Protocol is often touted as one of the most effective tools for deepening D/s and bonding a submissive to his/her Dominant. However, it can take years to journey from the introduction of D/s to various longstanding protocols – social, military, diplomatic, “Old Guard BDSM” –  advanced protocol that is optimized for your mission and values.</p><p>In Part 1 of this workshop, Thraje will take a deep dive into the more complex aspects of being dominant and employing protocol in BDSM, including - Construct of advanced personal BDSM protocol, structuring protocol for individuals and submissives/partners, maximizing responsiveness from submissives/partners, communication and discipline, and specific protocol tools.  In addition, Pixelvixen will share the accompanying submissive viewpoint to serving a values-based dominant and his/her personal and D/s or M/s protocols.</p>

					<h3>Advanced D/s and Protocol (Part 2) – Units & Communities</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In Part 2 Thraje will show you how to develop your own, personalized values-based dynamic and protocol. Committing to the exploration of D/s is a fantastic starting point...but deepening your D/s and making it more persistent becomes the real journey. So how do you extend your D/s dynamic and interactions beyond the boundaries of coupledom/partnership, including other partners, circles of friends, Houses, Leather families, and kinky community?</p><p>Thraje will also discuss the process of expanding the core protocol beyond the boundaries of self and partner, looking to multi-party dynamics (play partners, poly, families, houses), dominance hierarchies (the 4 most common structures), communication and discipline in multi-party dynamics, managing clashing protocol in houses and community, and successful community protocol for gatherings and parties.   In addition, Pixelvixen will share the accompanying submissive viewpoint to serving a values-based dominant and their multi-party protocols.</p>
