			No cell phones of any sort will be allowed in the dungeon during the members-only parties!
			</p>

			<p>
			As most of you know, communications technology keeps moving forward. There are now cell phones on the market that can take pictures as well as record conversations. All the user has to do is to point the cell phone in the direction of his/her subject, and push a button. If the subject does not want the picture taken, there is nothing he/she can do about it. The picture has already been snapped and emailed immediately to any email address in the world. This is a perfect tool for the paparazzi and the unscrupulous among us who use the likenesses of unwary and non-consenting citizens for their own profit, sexual satisfaction or political agendas. Unlike regular cameras, once a hapless photo subject discovers he/she has been photographed without consent, he/she cannot simply demand that the film or memory card be destroyed. It is too late! The picture is already socked away in the computer files of a complete stranger.
			</p>

			<p>
			Because Thunder in the Mountains is a private, membership-only organization, our members have a complete expectation of privacy. Therefore, we feel we would be remiss if we did not do everything we can to protect the privacy that our members depend upon. Because technology changes so rapidly, we do not feel we can adequately train our security to check all cell phones and make an accurate determination as to which cell phone is capable of taking pictures and which cell phone is not. We have decided, instead, to simply ban all cell phones from our member-only parties on both Friday and Saturday nights. For those of you who must stay in contact with family or babysitters, please leave word at the front desk of the hotel, and we will make every effort to reach you immediately.
			</p>

			<p>
			Although we have decided not to ban all cell phones during any other portion of our event, including our seminars and demos, all camera cell phones (those cell phones capable of taking pictures) ARE banned! We would ask that each of you assist us in watching out for any attendee who has a camera cell phone and who might be using a camera cell phone to take pictures. If you see a person whom you think either has a camera cell phone or who you suspect is taking pictures, please contact the nearest Thunder volunteer (wearing a Thunder in the Mountains volunteer t-shirt) and let that person know. He/she will contact either me, Brian Conway or our Security Director, and we will investigate the situation.
			</p>

			<p>
			Any member caught taking pictures with a cell phone camera (or any other photographic device) will have his/her membership immediately cancelled and the equipment permanently confiscated. That person will be banned from further participation in the event and will be permanently banned from the Thunder membership roles forever. This language will be added as a permanent part of the general release and rules that must be acquiesced to and signed by each member of Thunder in the Mountains.
			</p>

			<p>
			We want to thank all of you for helping to keep our event private!
