Anticipatory service, mental domination, and the graceful art of protocol are driving factors within their relationship.

It is a group dedicated to the education of the community regarding the many aspects of etiquette and protocol.

  bio: <p>Always prepared with a smile, a joke, and a length of rope, since the turn of the century Murphy Blue has been bringing his kink knowledge and signature style wherever he could.  A self-claimed "American Rigger", Murphy tries to focus not just on the “hows” of tying, but the frequently forgotten “whys” of tying as well. The interplay between people and energy through rope and gestures is something that should be passed along, and Murphy does his best to assist with that. </p><p>While he is mostly well known for his unique ropework, creative performances, bouncy demeanor, and intense love for Transformers, "The Blue" is also a scholar of different kinky endeavors, a skilled photographer, a budding writer, a practicing energy worker of multiple traditions, and a pretty darn good dancer. He is constantly searching for more information about the art of Shibari, experiencing different fetish environments and learning new skills. Murphy travels the country with the lovely ladies of "Team Blue", sharing insight, gaining knowledge, and saving the world, one knot at a time.</p><p>There is a much-circulated tale about Murphy being trapped by a Dark Council, and his only chance of survival was to suspend multiple women to please this Dark Council. When asked about this tale, Murphy will only smile. </p>
