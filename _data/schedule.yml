- title: It's a Trap - Playful Scenes & Non-Bondage Predicaments
  description: <p>This isn’t always serious work we do! Predicaments are all about putting your bottom between the proverbial rock and hard place (and laughing as they are flummoxed by their situation) - playful BDSM is about giggling together in scene and making your bottom participate in their own torment.</p><p>This class will show you how to bring a new level of engagement to your BDSM play and go beyond giving and receiving sensations – create story lines and connect mentally with your partner. Stefanos & Shay will also address the bottom’s perspective, including communicating within the “mood” of your scene and detailed discussion of “bratting.”</p><p>Leave your rope bag at home – this is NOT a bondage class! In addition to demonstrating many specific predicaments and “games,” Stefanos & Shay will discuss this type of play in a broad sense to guide you in developing your own unique scenes.</p>

- title: Skin Deep - Cutting for Play
  description: <p>There is nothing quite like the sensation of a cutting – the fear, as you see and feel a blade against your skin, the sharp, immediate pain as the cut is made, the slow tingle and wet feeling of blood dripping down your skin.</p><p>In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate surface cuttings using sterile scalpels, including information on both freehand and patterned cuttings using transfer paper. While they teach – and preach! – that you should always go into a cutting assuming it will scar, their focus in this class is to partake in cuttings as play (as opposed to cuttings as body modification) while seeking to minimize scars. There will be a focus on RACK and making cuttings as safe (with discussion by Shay, a medical professional) and sexy as possible.</p><p>While the technical information is a crucial starting point, this class will go beyond the basics, discussing cutting as spiritual play and working within a D/s dynamic. This is an advanced edge play topic. </p>

  description: <p>Religion is often a taboo subject, especially at the dinner table...  In his class Otter approaches religion and race with pure irreverence.  When diving into such taboo subjects profound experiences are guaranteed to happen so strap on your boots and leave the delicate sensitivities at the door.  This class will explore how to choose the proper play space, involving others in tertiary roles, using sacred symbols and language to evoke emotions, ways to create a ritual or religious experience through kink, and the potential catharsis and aftercare.  It cannot be stressed enough this class is not for the faint of heart...most belief systems will be discussed in reverent and irreverent ways that may be offensive to some people but entirely titillating to the rest of us.</p>

- title: Just the Basics
  description: <p>Covering the basics in rope bondage is particularly important.  This class not only tells you where to start, but we dive in and get our hands on each other.  Rope is not just a tool or a kink, but it is a mindset that is only confined by your imagination and willingness to explore.  You will leave this class with a few basic ties and insight into how to think rope not just tie it.  Bring your own rope, 6-8 lengths of rope.  Otter suggests 25-35 foot lengths of any of your bondage rope you like.  Also bring someone to tie on because this isn’t just a lecture.  It’s a hands-on lab setting!</p>

- title: Cathartic Flogging - Merging the Erotic and the Ecstatic
  description: <p>Webster’s defines catharsis as “an emotional purification or purgation that brings about spiritual renewal.” Catharsis provides release from tension, an increased feeling of aliveness, and can even serve as a catalyst for spiritual enlightenment. Through catharsis one can experience bliss. Provided that the proper intention, focus and egoic surrender are in place, the mindful use of a flogger provides an excellent opportunity for catharsis for both the Dom and the sub. Come discover the simple message of the flogger, and how that message can transform you…body, mind and spirit!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on flogging technique, but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice to facilitate catharsis.</p>

- title: Thunder Kiss - Love and Fear and the Single-Tail Whip
  description: <p>Who hasn’t been both attracted to—and frightened by—the crack of a single tail whip as it meets its intended target? In recent years there has been a surge of interest in single tail scenes, but the tremendous exponential function of force to sensation, not to mention the potential for serious injury, requires a learned proficiency and a disciplined focus in order to safely use such a whip on another human being. Equally important is a conscious understanding of the psycho-spiritual dynamics inherent in this intense percussive practice. In this third in a series of “Shamanic SM” presentations, Master Skip will explore those dynamics and reveal the possibility for transcendence they offer. Come discover how the mindful use of a single tail can facilitate a profound spiritual awakening, no matter which end of the whip you’re on!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on single tail technique but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice as a tool for Self-realization.</p>

  description: <p>Odaxelagnia – The fetish of biting or being bitten.  A sometimes misunderstood but widely practiced fetish. We will explore the historical evolution of biting as it has appeared in religious text, folklore and literature. </p><p>The majority of the class will be spent in a rountable demonstration format, discussing technique, practice, application and safety. There will be plenty of opportunity to learn and share your ideas about this fetish, from its simplest forms to more complex and animistic/ritualistic concepts. </p><p>With today’s restrictions on travel, this is an “Unarmed” fetish play that can be applied with little or no extraneous tools or toys, making it very easy and fun to explore the more wild and animal needs of your partner(s) or playmates. </p>
