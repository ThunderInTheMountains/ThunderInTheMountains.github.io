			Thunder in the Mountains Talent Show will be held on Saturday evening, June 27, 2015, at 7pm sharp.  The competition is open ONLY to paid members, and the privacy of this event will be secured under the same strict security criteria as the rest of the weekend.  Because we know our community contains some of the most talented people in the country, we would like to offer an opportunity to recognize some of this distinguished talent at Thunder 2015 by offering the following prizes.

            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>1st Place $300</li>
            <li>2nd Place $200</li>
            <li>3rd Place $100</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

			<p>
            Eligible Talent:  singing, dancing, acting, piano playing, karaoke, magic, comedy, drama, playing of any musical instrument, performance art, acrobatics, BDSM and scene performance (i.e. fire play, whip accuracy, rope bondage, etc.), and whatever else you think might win you a prize.  
		  </p>

			<p>
			Participants:  Any talent entry may be comprised of a single individual or a group of individuals. The number is up to you.  However, each participant must be a registered member of Thunder in the Mountains 2015.  In other words, only registered members may compete in the talent competition.  
		  </p>

			<p>
			Applications:  A representative for each act must fill out a complete online application (listed below on this website).  You must list the names of all participants and describe your act in detail.  ALL portions of the application must be filled out.  Within a few days after receiving your application, we will confirm receipt of your application by email.  
		  </p>

			<p>
			Time-Limits:  Because we will have only two hours in which to hold our Talent Competition on Saturday night of the event and because we can usually count on a number of entries, we are anticipating that each act can be no longer than 5 minutes each.  We would ask that you send in your application as soon as possible.  We will be able to accept only that number of applications that can be performed in a two hour show.  For now, acceptance of applications will be made on a first come first serve basis.  If we find, however, that we have far more applications than we have actual time slots, we may have to run a pre-competition on Friday night or Saturday day before the talent show.  We will keep all applicants informed of these possibilities as the time draws near.

            Judging:   Five judges will be named by Thunder in the Mountains, LLC. to judge the entries and award the cash prizes.  Because the judges will be selecting winners based upon the talent exhibited on the night of the show, we will not release the identity of the judges until that night.  Unlike title contests, our judges will not require an opportunity to meet and talk with the contestants ahead of time.  Neither popularity nor personality of entrants (except as exhibited on stage during the acts) will play any part in selecting our winners, and therefore, the identity of our judges will remain secret until the actual event.
