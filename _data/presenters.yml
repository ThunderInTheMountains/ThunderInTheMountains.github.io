  bio: <p>Sir Rob discovered BDSM at ~7 while watching classic Star Trek. He began earnestly exploring Leather in Seattle at 21 under the guidance of Leather Daddy Dave Lewis. He now lives in Chicago, where he is the membership chair of the renowned gay men’s BDSM club, the Chicago Hellfire Club, which he has been a member of since 2003. He specializes in impact play (punching, spanking, caning, flogging, paddling), nipple torture, fisting, and play piercings. He also enjoys a little CBT and breath control added to the mix. Besides enjoying the naughty, forbidden, and sexual in SM play, he finds SM to be spiritual and artistic. The body is an amazing canvas for bruises and marks; and needles can be used to create intricate designs. He loves those moments in play where everything else fades except the person with whom he is playing and the connection they have established. He especially enjoys the connection that is created when he is given the gift of submission. As Great Lakes Leather Sir 2008, he was first runner-up at ILS/b 2008.</p>
