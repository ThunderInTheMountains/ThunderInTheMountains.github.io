- title: If You Like It, You Should Put a Ring On It! Cock and Ball Accessorizing 
  description: <p>This highly interactive class will look at sexy, intense, and entertaining ways to “decorate” the cocks in your life. Stefanos & Shay will start with a basic discussion of anatomy, safety considerations, negotiation, and circumcised vs. intact vs. strap-on cocks, then move into formal accessories like cock rings and chastity devices — you’re encouraged to bring your favorites for “show-and-tell”!</p><p>They will then demonstrate multiple cock and ball bondage techniques, including using bondage to create a cock ring, wrapping everything up in a neat (and easy!) package, making a cock “helicopter,” creating a kynodesme (google it!), and cock bondage for chastity. Class participants are encouraged to practice along and get creative!</p><p>The instructors will provide cord for in-class use. They may be able to pair people up (or you can practice on yourself), but you’re encouraged to come to this session with a willing “stunt cock” of your own. </p><p>This class is demo, lecture, some discussion, and hands-on. Participation appreciated!</p>

- title: Precipice - Extreme Edge Play
  description: <p>Violent assault, humiliation, terror, interrogation, forced sex… playing on the brink can be vastly rewarding, but also psychologically and physically dangerous (which is of course part of the appeal). Stefanos & Shay will demonstrate & discuss types of edge play scenes, negotiation & aftercare for this type of play, and the how & why of taking yourself (and your partner/s) to the limit… and then pulling them (and yourself) back.</p><p>This class includes numerous demos, including emotional edge play, sexual consensual non-consent, gun play, use of “trigger words,” realistic and personal portrayal of domestic abuse, and rough body play, as well as participatory discussion about “soft limits” and risk awareness in the context of edge play. Throughout, Stefanos & Shay emphasize using edge play for catharsis and empowerment.</p><p>This class is not for beginners and contains content that many participants find triggering (often in unexpected ways). NO LATE ENTRY allowed for this session. </p>

- title: Ask Me If I Care; Tough Love for the Kinky 
  description: <p>Created in response to the informal (and often impromptu) Q&A sessions after readings, this is an interactive opportunity to talk with the author of the Marketplace series and The Killer Wore Leather.  Ask anything. Kinky queries, philosophy, books, writing & publishing, fantasies, Jewish holidays - anything. Relationship issues? Ask away. But don’t expect sugar-coated answers - this can be Tough Love for the Kinky. Dear Abby can take a hike; Laura may not care, but she respects the community enough to tell the truth formed of 30 freaking years of experience and far too many confessions. Questions may be taken in advance, asked in person or even submitted anonymously at this discussion.</p>

- title: Service with a Smile - Tactics for Overcoming Temporary Obstacles in Being Your Best
  description: <p>Service is a way to demonstrate admiration, caring, respect, affection, and of course, love. It can also be a reward in and of itself, but that only goes so far. Fantasies, intentions, promises and expectations are all tested by real-world human behavior - and sometimes, it's just going to be a bitch to handle. Bad moods, faulty communication, illness, unexpected consequences and stress of all kinds will poke even the best of servants and wreck havoc with any relationship. Laura will discuss strategies in overcoming temporary distractions that keep a service-oriented individual from performing their best. Also addressed are questions of basic needs in a relationship, and ways of determining, for yourself, if the relationship you are in is positive or negative, whether you have temporary difficulties, or consistent ones. Workshop participants are encouraged to share ways they have discovered to keep a proper service mentality, and to being up the challenges of being servile - without hurting themselves or allowing harm from another.</p><p><b>NOTE</b> - To encourage honesty and open communication, this workshop is limited to those individuals providing service, rather than managing or receiving service.</p>

- title: Transparent D/s - From Projection to Reflection
  description: <p>Because, as the Talmud teaches, “We don’t see things as they are, we see things as we are,” relationships of all types are often rife with projection. If such projection goes unrecognized and unaddressed, then alienation, isolation and, ultimately, dissolution of the relationship is the result. In the case of an D/s relationship, the submissive projects his or her ideas, feelings and attitudes regarding authority figures onto the Dominant, and if that projection includes anger, fear, blame or guilt, the toll it takes on both the relationship and the Dominant’s self-esteem can be tremendous. In this enlightening presentation Master Skip will explore the underlying psycho-spiritual dynamics that make it possible for a Dominant to stand in the middle of a submissive’s projection without moving, neither accepting the projection nor rejecting it and, in doing so, facilitate the submissive’s awareness of the projection, the Dominant’s strengthened sense of competency and the realization of the true nature of the relationship for them both.</p>

- title: D/s Ethics and Expectations - The Value of a Personal Code
  description: <p>Because D/s relationships are arguably more intentional in their construct than their “vanilla” counterparts, having advance knowledge of where you and your Dominant/submissive stand on the fundamental, practical and ethical issues facing your relationship should be a given. Yet how many of us, when confronted with challenging situations and circumstances, have been shocked to discover that not only were we ignorant of our Dom’s or sub’s POV on a particular matter, we didn’t know how we ourselves felt until we were in the thick of it? Avoiding such potentially damaging surprises is just one of the many benefits of a personal code, and in this highly-interactive presentation Master Skip will explore the necessity and value of a personal code for both Dominants and submissives, offer some tips on how to craft such a code, and then provide both time and opportunity for you to begin the crafting process for yourself.</p>

Endorphins are those sensations that your body makes to give you a natural high. Long distance runners experience a runner’s high that is very similar.

- title: Jealousy - Learning to Dance With the Green-Eyed Monster
  description: <p>We spend a lot of time trying to avoid jealousy, or attempting to control the behavior of others so we don't have to face our fears. What if we could see jealousy as an emotion that shows us to ourselves? That it's something with which we can dance as we navigate the sea of self-care and self-awareness? For people who wish to live a healthy, ethical non-monogamous life this work is essential. For monogamous folk it's equally useful to get a handle on how each of us "does" jealousy, so we can take responsibility for our emotions and how they affect our behavior.</p><p>Nina believes that our emotions are more about us than the are about the people in our lives, who simply operate as mirrors, showing us to ourselves for better or worse. Once we understand that jealousy doesn't come from the outside, but resides within each of us, we can do the work to make peace with ourselves and honor the hidden emotions and needs behind jealousy.</p><p>Using her own journey from jealousy to its opposite, compersion, Nina will share with you what worked for her and answer all questions.</p>

- title: Pussy Whispering
  description: <p>To quote master Ernest Greene, “Her pleasure is the source of your power.” As a BDSM player whose style is always sexually-motivated, it’s behooved me to learn all I can about vulvas, how to talk to them, how to listen to them and how to make them so happy they’re eager to make a return date before leaving your dungeon.</p><p>Join veteran porn performer and pussy-hound Nina Hartley as she shares what she knows about pussies and how to pet them, hold them, caress and penetrate them to maximum mutual benefit and delight. As she likes to say, “I can’t do all the ladies, myself. I need your help!”</p><p>The more you know the greater your confidence, which in turn attracts quality partners into your orbit. </p><p>You’ll learn basic internal and external anatomy, cover the basic sexual response cycle and learn to effectively translate, and transmit, your energy and intention into your partner, using her vulva and sexual arousal as the delivery system. As I like to day, A fun time to be had by all!</p><p>If you’re the owner of a vulva you’ll learn how to use it to communicate directly with your partner, bypassing the need for words, when words are not available to you.</p><p>Expect to laugh while you learn and then practice your new skills that very night . . . .</p>
