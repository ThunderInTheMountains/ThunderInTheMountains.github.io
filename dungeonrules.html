  I hereby agree:</p>

I further agree that any such equipment brought into Thunder in the Mountains in violation of the terms of this agreement shall immediately become the sole property of Thunder in the Mountains, LLC.

  <li>That by signing this Terms of Membership Agreement I agree of my own free will to all terms of the membership and that if I do not fully and completely agree with all terms of memberships, I have been requested and advised by the staff of Thunder in the Mountains not to become a member until such time as I can in good faith and with complete honestly and assurance agree to all such terms.</li>

  <li>NO CELL PHONES or PDA DEVICES of any sort will be allowed in the dungeon during Friday and Saturday night membership-only parties.

For those of you who must stay in contact with family members or babysitters, please leave word at the front desk of the hotel, and we will make every effort to reach you immediately.

  <li>For the protection of everyone present, please use gloves and other safety equipment located throughout the dungeon.</li>
  <li>Cleaning supplies are available throughout the dungeon. If you do a scene involving wax, blood or urine, or a scene which results in residue of some sort please use a drop cloth or tarp. Please clean up after your scene. Leave all equipment free from sweat, blood, and other bodily fluids, wax, toys etc. Bring ANY bodily fluid contamination immediately to the attention of the DM.</li>

  <li><strong>NO ANIMALS ARE ALLOWED </strong>inside the secure area of the Thunder in the Mountains space.&nbsp; Thunder in the Mountains, is a private membership-only event and is not bound by the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and may, therefore, disallow entry by animals of any kind for any reason.&nbsp; Our only exception to this rule is for seeing-eye dogs for the visually impaired.&nbsp; All questions regarding entry by ANY animal must be approved <strong>ONLY</strong> by the event producers Rich Dockter or Brian Conway.</li>
</ol>

  <p>_____ I further understand and agree that Thunder in the Mountains is a private membership organization and that the privacy of all members of Thunder in the Mountains is of paramount importance to such members. For that reason and as part of the binding terms of my membership, I represent and agree that I am not joining Thunder in the Mountains nor attending this event as a news/media/broadcast reporter, investigator, or gatherer of facts &amp; information for any news/media/broadcast outlet in <em>any</em> capacity. If I should divulge to any news/media/broadcast organization or to any reporter or media representative of such organization anything I see, hear, hear about, participate in, or photograph while attending this event as a member of Thunder in the Mountains, whether or not the actual personal privacy of any member is actually violated, I hereby recognize and agree that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to estimate the damages that Thunder in the Mountains, LLC. might incur for such membership violations and disclosures of its private organization, and therefore, I agree that a reasonable calculation of the total detriment that Thunder in the Mountains, LLC. would suffer in the event of such disclosure is and shall be, as the sole and exclusive remedy and not as a penalty, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) as the Liquidated Damages Amount.&rdquo; &nbsp;I recognize and agree that in the event of <em>any </em>publication, disclosure, or media release whatsoever, the news/media/broadcast outlet and I shall <em>each </em>be held separately liable to Thunder in the Mountains, LLC. For the total Liquidated Damages Amount of One Million (1,000,000) as specified Above.</p>
