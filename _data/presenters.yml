- name: Dart
  title: 
  linkname: 
  linkurl: 
  bio: Master Dart's interest in leather and BDSM play can be traced as far back as his early childhood years, citing a huge fascination with what was being done to Robin on the Batman television series…and to the furry cowboys on Gunsmoke. When other boys were caught with porn magazines under their beds…Dart was caught with a roll of duct tape. Since then he has developed an immense passion for rope bondage, not to mention the men he likes to tie up with it. Dart began his leather journey as a collared boy and gradually developed into the dominant he is today. He believes in the importance of “balance” when exploring one’s dominant and submissive side in play, and that great benefit can come from experiencing both elements. Master Dart’s kinky interests in addition to rope bondage include puppy play and training, chest and gut punching, and most recently, fire play. He sees himself as "proudly New Guard" because he feels that what is most important is not what happened in the past but what is happening NOW, and that our sexual self-expression should not be hindered by rigid or judgemental 'rules' from our past.  Among the cities, organizations and events Dart has presented in include sitting on the educational board for Mr. Leatherman Toronto,  Spring Iniquity in Houston, Thunder in the Mountains in Denver,  GEAR Ireland in Dublin,  Leather Pride in Amsterdam, and the Rome BDSM Conference.   He also hosts his own leather podcast program on ITunes, called Dart’s Domain.  He shares his life with his husband,  Sir Bart. They reside in Virginia Beach.

  class1title: Landmines
  class1description: In kink and BDSM, we all bring a certain amount of 'baggage' to the table. And some of us even bring freight!   While these are elements of what makes us all human, they can become a critical issue when it comes to the intensity of the power exchange that exists in a kink relationship. A LANDMINE refers to what happens when a negative element of our past gets triggered during the course of that relationship, be it in play or otherwise. In this class Master Dart will facilitate a discussion about some of the possible landmines that can come up in the course of a D/s relationship or playscene, and how we can deal their accidental detonation and grow from them.
