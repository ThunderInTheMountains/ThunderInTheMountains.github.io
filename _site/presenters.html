				<h2>Laura Antoniou</h2>
				
				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.lantoniou.com/" target="_blank">Laura Antoniou</a></h3>

					<h3>For Your Own Good - Using Punishment in your SM Relationships</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Laura will explore the reasons for, and effective methods of punishment to enhance and strengthen a relationship based upon authority and obedience.  Drawing from her personal experience and longtime observations, Laura will discuss punishment and its myths, uses, limits, and how to create punishments that are appropriate to the moment, while being erotic and enjoyable to the enforcer. You will learn how to use punishment  to benefit both top and bottom and reinforce the values of your relationship.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Ask Me If I Care; Tough Love for Tough Players</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This class was created in response to the informal (and sometimes impromptu) Q&A sessions after readings and it is an interactive opportunity to talk with the author of the Marketplace series. Don’t expect sugar-coated answers - this is Tough Love for tops, bottoms, couples and/or other groupings. Dear Abby can take a hike; Laura may not care, but she respects the community enough to tell the truth. Questions may be submitted anonymously or bravely offered at this discussion. Sacred cows may be slaughtered. Triggering is almost certainly going to happen for someone. And there will absolutely be laughs. If you have questions for this wise and outspoken icon of the BDSM literary world, you should either write them down or memorize them to bring up in the class.  But be warned…..your question will be answered with TRUTH!</p>

					<h3>Belt Bondage for Rough Sex.…Buckle Up and Fuck!</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Even the most basic belt can be used in dozens of ways to restrain your partner for effective and minimalist bondage or rough sex either used alone or in combination with other belts, devices, and furniture. Such implements can also be used for a variety of creative and intense impact play options. In this hands on class, Danarama will demonstrate and coach you on the fast and effective uses of one of the most common items nearly everyone has on hand. Don't let your belt just go to waist!</p><br><ul><ol><li>Selecting and altering belts for bondage use</li><li>Hand and arm restraint (single and double column)</li><li>Thigh restraints</li><li>Belting people to objects</li><li>Rough sex applications</li><li>Corporal punishment techniques</li><li>Orchestrating entire scenes with belts & transitions</Li></ol></ul>

					<h3>Creative Mindfuckery</h3>
					<p>
					<p>The physical aspects of S/m can only go so far in taking people into subspace. Headspace is where it's at. But you don't have to be a hypnotist, psychologist or shaman to get there. Danarama shares a wide range of techniques, from communication-flytraps to home-built props and sleights of hand that you can use to delve into your partner's mind and play upon their fears in ways that are terrifyingly realistic and effective, yet physically safe and easily wiped away like a bad dream. Featuring live demonstrations, craft instructions, basic practical magicianship and discussions into the darker sides like interrogation and brainwashing, Dan will arm you with the tools to take your scenes to a new dimension. </p><p><ol><li>Brain-stalking, f.k.a.

				<p>Widely considered a BDSM authority, Mr. Dawson’s expertise is in demand by community groups across the nation. He possesses the unique ability to convey nuances to those in both active and passive roles, helping them to understand that they share a single energy source but draw from it in different ways.

He has presented at many leather events including Thunder in the Mountains, South Plains Leather, Southeast Leatherfest and Tribal Fire. As a member of Avatar Club Los Angeles, Mr. Dawson believes in the tradition of passing knowledge on to those who seek a deeper understanding of the role of Leather and BDSM practices in their lives. His wisdom of experience and traditional Leatherman values combined with a contemporary view appeals to both newcomers and experienced audiences alike.

					<h3>Creativity in SM (Class and Demonstration)</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This class is designed for players (both Top and bottom) who have experienced a creative block in their SM play.  It has happened to all of us! You’ve tied them up, you’ve flogged them, and you’ve offered after care---just like you’ve done a hundred times.  In this class Mr. Dawson will show you how to explore and defeat the barriers to creating new and imaginative scenes.  He will take you through a series of improvisational SM scenes centered upon your participation. This is a very fun class that invites and encourages audience participation!  You don’t want to miss this class taught by one of our premiere leather teachers.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Cock and Ball Torture</h3>
					<p>
					<p>After a brief overview of the male anatomy, Mr. Dawson will discuss with you the various ways that your family jewels can be put in peril.  Threats of castration, bondage, attachment, torment and torture all come to mind as possibilities.  You will learn easy techniques to get  started and more advanced tricks to keep you heavy players interested.  Ample time will be set aside to experiment with your own equipment.  This session is appropriate for both men and curious women with a sub. </p><p>Requirements for the class include bringing a 30" piece of lightweight rope about the weight of parachute lacing, other favorite toys to share and a willingness to get naked with the rest of the group (men only). Don’t be shy! You can come by yourself or with a male or female partner; either way you will leave with new tricks and a big smile on your face.</p><p>Handouts:<br>PDF Download <a href="public/pdf/Dawson_CBT.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>

					<h3>Restrictive Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Dunter will offer an introduction on safety tips related to bondage in general and restrictive bondage specifically.

					<h3>Rough Body Play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class you will learn to bring an amazing amount of energy to a scene like no other.  There will be no need for a fancy flogger or other type of implement when you already have the best arsenal of weaponry in the world using your own limbs and body.  Dunter will teach very intense play with easy take downs & immobilization while at the same time showing you how to remain entirely within the safe zone.  You will also learn to use your body as a tool for impact play and engage in very intimate physical contact with your partner.  The scene becomes a kind of close quarter combat for kinky people and you learn an unarmed combat skill you can use in your day to day kinky life with your partner.  In showing you how to remain safe, you will learn the basics of anatomy….where to hit…..how to hit…how to play with tempo and increase or decrease your momentum.  This workshop is definitely hands-on.</p>

					<h3>Breath Play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Obviously breath play is considered one of the most dangerous and edgy of all BDSM activities, requiring responsibility, trust, and scrupulous safety practices on the part of both the top and the bottom. In this workshop Mark Frazier will focus on different & varied methods used to restrict a person’s breathing in order to facilitate the release of endorpohans that we all crave. Mark will also focus on safety concerns and how to minimize the occurrence of any potential problems. At the end of the informational part of this class, Mark will conclude with a hands-on demonstration.</p><p>We would like to note that Mark has been teaching this class for almost 30 years, and he tells us that this will be the last time he teaches it. So, if you want to avail yourself of Mark’s 30 years of experience and information, this is a class you cannot miss!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Fisting</h3>
					<p>
					<p> Handing complete control of your sphincter, your anus, your rectum, and your lower colon to another human being can be one of the most daunting experiences a person can undergo.   This type of play involves a huge level of trust by the fistee of the fister, but once this trust has been established, fisting can become one of the most personally emotional and satisfying types of play anyone can participate in.   As a result, fisting becomes one of the most intimate ways to touch and make love to another person.  In this class, Mark Frazier will discuss the proper techniques of entry by the top, ways to relax by the bottom, the safety concerns, and dealing with the unreal feeling of "openness" and connection with another person.  If you are one of those people who wants to experience this beautiful type of play or if you are one of those who have already indulged in it and want to learn more, then this is a class you HAVE to attend! </p>

					<h3>Anatomy for Rope (Lecture)</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Based on common injuries and problems, this course will take a practical look at the human anatomy as it relates to rope. Nerve injuries will be the major focus of this class, and students will see why those should be of primary concern when you are engaging in this type of scene. Rope can never be without some inherent risk, but following this course, riggers and bottoms will better understand why some problems occur and how they can mitigate them.  No previous medical or rope experience is needed to attend this class, but having had some suspension experience will increase the benefits of this class for students.  This class is for beginners and experience with rope is beneficial but not necessary.</p>

					<h3>Deepen your D/s - Protocols, Rituals, Rewards and Punishments</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This class covers the many and varied types of protocols designed to help cultivate a fulfilling D/s lifestyle. In the class Honey will show you how to incorporate these rituals into your daily life, how to train, correct, and reinforce your desired behaviors effectively, and she will illustrate some examples of obstacles that we must overcome in creating functional D/s relationships. As a full-time lifestyle submissive, Honey will introduce you to all sorts of techniques for strengthening your training and play, from both sides of the slash.  Whether you have a slave or are a slave, this class is well worth your time and effort to attend and learn.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Responsible Bottoming for Everyone</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Contrary to what it may sometimes seem, bottoms are not just interchangeable bodies whose only responsibilities are listing limits, taking pain and occasionally using safe wording. A great bottom can help a top get more out of a scene, elevate a scene from good to great, and even open the door to even edgier types of play.  Honey will begin by discussing what can make an experience  great for both the top and the bottom, and what you can do to enhance the experience, even if you're not the one throwing rope or a whip. She will then move on to talk about types of effective negotiation and communication during scenes, as well as ways to protect yourself and what to do if things go awry. She will examine everything from light pickup play to safely exploring heavier and edgier play, and various types of consent models. Regardless of what you're interested in, Honey will help you to be a more informed partner, as well as giving you  the tools you need in order to foster an amazing scene--from the bottom!  Whether you are a top or the bottom, this is a class you won’t want to miss!</p>

				<h2>Lizard</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Lizard is a rope bondage enthusiast, with a propensity towards mental and emotional sadism. She began tying four years ago at a rope share group known as the Knotting Circle, and since then, has become to be a lifelong student of rope. Lizard gathers inspiration and knowledge from teachers, peers, and most notably, from the people that she ties. She is most well known for her innovative, "outside of the box" style of rope, which favors intention and adaptability over traditional aesthetics.</P><p>As an educator, Lizard is both informative and entertaining. When teaching, she draws from her experiences on both sides of the rope, as well as her career as a healthcare professional. Her passion and sense of humor make for an engaging class while her adaptive approach to rope inspires creativity and encourages problem solving.</p><p>Lizard believes in making rope education a collaborative effort between tops and bottoms. As a presenter, she applies this principle by using a co-teaching strategy with her partners. She also encourages active participation and feedback from the people who are tied in her class, so the everyone may learn from varying experiences.</p><p>Native to the DC/Baltimore scene, Lizard has taught for local programs such as Krakens AKademy and Black Rose, as well as larger conventions like Dark Odyssey Winter Fire, where her “Bare Bones Bondage” class (taught with honey_bare) received high acclaim for making rope bondage “accessible” to everyone.</p><p>“One of the rising stars of contemporary rope bondage performance and education.” - Cannon (Bondage Club Ann Arbor)</P>

					<h3>Bare Bones Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Lizard will teach a series of simple and efficient ties designed to restrain, contort, and torture. These ties are both easy for the top and challenging for the bottom. Most of these can be done with one (sometimes, two) lengths of rope, and with practice, can be done in under two minutes for each tie. For beginners, that means you will spend less time reviewing the steps of a takate kote on youtube, and more time spent connecting with your partner. These ties make great scene starters, whether you’re doing rope for the sake of rope, or using restraint as a means to do sensation play, impact play, sex play, etc.</p><p>To participate you will need to bring 2 lengths of natural fiber rope (7-8 meters each), an emergency rope cutting tool, suspension hardware (optional), and note taking supplies (optional).</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Microbondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>From fingers and toes to hair and facial features, it’s the “little things” that can have a big impact on your rope scene. Learn when and how to give or take that last inch of control. Attendees who are tying may find it helpful to have some experience with freeform rope bondage and rope handling but it is certainly not necessary.</p><p>To participate you will need to bring 1-2 lengths of 3-6mm diameter ropes (7-8 meters each in length), emergency rope cutting tool, a scarf or pillowcase (optional), note taking supplies (optional)</p>

				<h2>Lady Marquetta</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Lady Marquetta and Leonis began their journey as Mistress and slave in 2009 when Leonis came into Her service.  In April of 2010, Lady Marquetta collared Leonis as Her permanent slave. They live a 24/7 TPE lifestyle in Her House, Domus Sadicus, a Victorian-Leather House. It encompasses a variety of lifestyles, including Victorian, Gorean, Military, and ‘Alfredian’ (think of Batman’s unflappable butler gone kinky). Anticipatory service, mental domination, and the graceful art of protocol are driving factors within their relationship. The only ‘role playing’ to be found within their lives is when they step into the vanilla world of work, school, and sometimes family.</p><p>Lady Marquetta founded the Colorado Etiquette and Protocol Society in 2010, which Leonis helps to maintain as well as presenting classes. It is a group dedicated to the education of the community regarding the many aspects of etiquette and protocol. They volunteer, and support organizations such as Leather Magik, the NLA, MAsT, and VooDoo Leatherworks. Lady Marquetta has served as Dungeon Master for Thunder in the Mountains for the past six years.</p><p>She teaches classes on Dungeon Monitoring, Safety/First Aid/CPR, Etiquette and Protocol, Electrical/Violet Wand play, and Ms/Ds relationship dynamics. She has judged at Leather events, and she and Leonis have presented classes nationally. She was a mentor and administrator for the Colorado Mentors Program, and Leonis mentored for the Colorado sub Mentors Program. They also represented Colorado at the Southwest Leather Conference as the Colorado Master/slave for 2013.</p><p>They are advocates of education in life, and in the lifestyle. They teach about many subjects, but emphasize the importance of inclusion within the diversified community of the Leather. They teach how Leather’s central tenet of Honor will continue to forge a stronger, more educated, and more enlightened Leather future.</p>

					<h3>Anticipatory Service, “The Felicity of Foresight”</h3>
					<p>
					<p>There are many manners and modes of service established throughout the D/s lifestyle. Anticipatory Service is one ‘manner of service’ in which the submissive or slave strives to fulfill the Master’s, or Mistress’s needs and desires before a command is issued. It is but one brand of service, but one that nurtures and deepens the dynamic that exists in a D/s and M/s Leather relationship. It is one that requires devotion, patience, and self-examination among other elements, but its result is a seamless state-of-mind service that shines through the actualization of action and behavior, from the simple tasks to any formal activity. Lady Marquetta and her slave, Leonis, invite you to join them as they guide you through the beauty and elegance of this perceptive manner of service. This will be an interactive class and they encourage participation of all attendees in order to engage in some “hands-on” experience.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>The Elegant Art of High Protocol</h3>
					<p>
					<p>The term "High Protocol" can, and often inspires images of reserved revelry and dignified duty. It also, however, can incite intimidation, bewilderment, and an intense amount of stress. These interpretations of High Protocol, furthermore, result in the same thing, a highly rewarding, and elegant experience for the Host/Hostess, the Masters and Mistresses, and the slaves as well, who attend, participate and enjoy its every facet.</p><p>We will examine and discuss, of course, High Protocol Events, including High Protocol Dinners. What are they, what are they not. We will survey their attributes, and benefits for the Leather Community, and consider the many unseen elements of High Protocol. For instance, the kitchen staff at a High Protocol Dinner. Their contribution is a seamless symphony of preparation, flawless presentation, and choreographed service which creates an unrivaled and unmatched performance of elegance that no five-star restaurant can match. The mystery of High Protocol remains a steadfast component, and an emotive event within our Lifestyle origins. This class will attempt to demystify the elements and allow the entire community to embrace its grandeur. Lady Marquetta and her slave, Leonis, invite you to join them as they explain the intrinsic aspects of mental domination and how guiding the mind deepens the host of dynamics present in our Lifestyle.</p>

					<h3>Scarf Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Do you want to bring sizzling, sexy, fun, and easy erotic bondage to your bedroom without having to bother with expensive gear or complicated ropes? In this class Midori will show you how to combine sex with super easy bondage using beautiful, stealthy scarves! You will learn fun sexy position techniques and how to change positions quickly. Midori will also teach you safe non-rope ties for sex in various positions, sexual sensation enhancement with good positions, and more.</p><p>This class also includes Midori’s Scarf Dildo Harness! </p><p>Midori came up with this totally simple, amazing “do-it-yourself” Dildo Harness design. It’s also known as the Midori Elegant Harness.  It’s great for all body types, genders, and configuration of bits. It works great with after-market, store-bought or original-issue-self-sprouted bits. It proves itself remarkably stable  and fantastic for insertable dildos!  Clever and simple. Midori will bring all of the tools for the class and some dildoes, but you are all welcome to bring your own. </p><p>Some scarves will be available too - but if you have a couple of long scarves or ropes, you should bring them.  There will be practice time.  So please bring a beach towel or yoga mat and a pillow or two if you like. You should wear comfortable clothing. (All the exercises will be fully clothed.) Bring scarves if you like. Otherwise equipment and scarves will be provided.</p>

				<h2>Murphy Blue</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Always prepared with a smile, a joke, and a length of rope, since the turn of the century Murphy Blue has been bringing his kink knowledge and signature style wherever he could.  A self-claimed "American Rigger", Murphy tries to focus not just on the “hows” of tying, but the frequently forgotten “whys” of tying as well. The interplay between people and energy through rope and gestures is something that should be passed along, and Murphy does his best to assist with that. </p><p>While he is mostly well known for his unique ropework, creative performances, bouncy demeanor, and intense love for Transformers, "The Blue" is also a scholar of different kinky endeavors, a skilled photographer, a budding writer, a practicing energy worker of multiple traditions, and a pretty darn good dancer. He is constantly searching for more information about the art of Shibari, experiencing different fetish environments and learning new skills. Murphy travels the country with the lovely ladies of "Team Blue", sharing insight, gaining knowledge, and saving the world, one knot at a time.</p><p>There is a much-circulated tale about Murphy being trapped by a Dark Council, and his only chance of survival was to suspend multiple women to please this Dark Council. When asked about this tale, Murphy will only smile. </p>

					<h3>The Many Moods of Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>A tie can possess many moods, from erotic to dominating to violent to protecting.  In this class Murphy Blue will look at those moods and demonstrate for us those areas from where the top should draw inspiration, what things might be added to a scene to make it flow more dynamically, and what it might look like when the moods come together.  If you are one of those players who appreciates the various moods that arise during a bondage scene, then this is a class you won’t want to miss!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Sexable Shibari (Hands-on Demo)</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Did you ever get your partner tied up, riled up, and ready to go only to find that an awesome tie you have completed needs to be undone before “getting down to business?”   In this demonstration Murphy Blue will focus on a few ties and positions that allow that type of “full sexual access” you are looking for.  For those of you who always seem to love including good old sex in your bondage scenes, this class will prove invaluable to your kinky love making.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>
				Stefanos & Shay are a vivacious, unconventional D/s couple whose entertaining, information-packed classes have been called "better than a Vegas act.” They identify as pansexual polyamorous playsluts, purveyors of perversion, and alliteration fetishists!

					<h3>In Your Place - Headspace & Protocols for Power Exchange</h3>
					<p>
					<p>"Headspace” is a much-ballyhooed concept in BDSM, especially when it comes to power exchange. While it can seem like a nebulous idea, there are very specific  things you can do to get into headspace, or help your partner(s) find theirs. In this interactive class, Stefanos & Shay will draw from their years of experience in an unconventional D/s relationship  to discuss & demonstrate the use of protocols and other methods to establish a D/s dynamic for a scene. They will start with specific verbal protocols, including manners of address and communicating within the “mood” of your scene (particularly from the s-type’s perspective). Next they’ll cover physical protocols, with a focus on position training. This class focuses on scene-based (vs. everyday) power exchange. Throughout the class, Stefanos & Shay will aim to help you create and individualize protocols for your own unique dynamics. (This class contains elements of demo, lecture, discussion, and class interaction.)</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Pyro-Passion - Fire play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Take your fire play beyond the basics! In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate methods for making your fire play sensual, erotic, and painless… or “punishing” the masochist in your life with a scary and sadistic fire scene. They will explain pyro tools, safety, executing a scene and psychology of pyro-passion, followed by specific techniques including fire with wands, spraying, flashing, bubbles, foam, and cupping. Fire play requires constant attention to the details of the process as well as the rewards- this class emphasizes safety and mindfulness. At the end of the session, there will be an intense demo bringing all these skills together. (This class is demo and lecture, with some class participation/discussion.)</p>
