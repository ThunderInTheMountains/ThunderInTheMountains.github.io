- title: It's a Trap - Playful Scenes & Non-Bondage Predicaments
  description: <p>This isn’t always serious work we do! Predicaments are all about putting your bottom between the proverbial rock and hard place (and laughing as they are flummoxed by their situation) - playful BDSM is about giggling together in scene and making your bottom participate in their own torment.</p><p>This class will show you how to bring a new level of engagement to your BDSM play and go beyond giving and receiving sensations – create story lines and connect mentally with your partner. Stefanos & Shay will also address the bottom’s perspective, including communicating within the “mood” of your scene and detailed discussion of “bratting.”</p><p>Leave your rope bag at home – this is NOT a bondage class! In addition to demonstrating many specific predicaments and “games,” Stefanos & Shay will discuss this type of play in a broad sense to guide you in developing your own unique scenes.</p>

- title: Skin Deep - Cutting for Play
  description: <p>There is nothing quite like the sensation of a cutting – the fear, as you see and feel a blade against your skin, the sharp, immediate pain as the cut is made, the slow tingle and wet feeling of blood dripping down your skin.</p><p>In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate surface cuttings using sterile scalpels, including information on both freehand and patterned cuttings using transfer paper. While they teach – and preach! – that you should always go into a cutting assuming it will scar, their focus in this class is to partake in cuttings as play (as opposed to cuttings as body modification) while seeking to minimize scars. There will be a focus on RACK and making cuttings as safe (with discussion by Shay, a medical professional) and sexy as possible.</p><p>While the technical information is a crucial starting point, this class will go beyond the basics, discussing cutting as spiritual play and working within a D/s dynamic. This is an advanced edge play topic. </p>
