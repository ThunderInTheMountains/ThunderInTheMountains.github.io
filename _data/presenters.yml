  bio: <p>Midori is a renowned educator and writer on sexuality. Dubbed “the super nova of kink” by Dan Savage, she emerged from the Sex Positive Movement in San Francisco in the early 1990’s, soon becoming a much sought after international presenter on sexuality, personal fulfillment and kinky adventures.</p><p>Her reputation as authority and leading expert on alternative pleasures stem not only from her unique and entertaining process of teaching concrete skills, but in her ability to deconstruct and distill complex matters of desire into surprisingly accessible lessons with eloquence and humanity. She’s known for tackling challenging topics with fresh and relevant insights. She calls this her “head-heart-hands” method to create a space where people are allowed individual self-exploration. Fundamentally she is motivated by helping people to create authentic and intimate relationships while emphasizing self actualization, shame reduction, acceptance and justice.</p><p>Her writing is extensive, ranging from numerous articles, columns, works of fiction, to instructional books. She is the author of The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage, Wild Side Sex, and Master Han's Daughter.  She leads transformative small group intensives, including Rope Dojo ®, ForteFemme - Women’s Dominance Weekend Intensive and Passionate Bonds - Creating Effective D/s Protocol.  When she's not traveling and teaching, she's creating provocative and haunting art and performances.</p><p>Support her fight against HIV! She volunteers for AIDS LifeCycle. <br><a href="www.tofighthiv.org/goto/midori" target="_blank">www.tofighthiv.org/goto/midori</a><br><a href="www.FHP-inc.com" target="_blank">www.FHP-inc.com</a><br><a href="www.RopeDojo.com" target="_blank">www.RopeDojo.com</a><br><a href="www.ForteFemme.com" target="_blank">www.ForteFemme.com</a><br><a href="www.passionatebonds.com" target="_blank">www.passionatebonds.com</a></p><p>Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Vimeo - @PlanetMidori<br>FetLife - Midori</p><p>PlanetMidori Podcast Diary <br><a href="http://planetmidori.libsyn.com/podcast" target"_blank">planetmidori.libsyn.com/podcast</a></p><p>Resource List:<br>PDF Download <a href="public/pdf/Midori_ResourceList2016.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>
