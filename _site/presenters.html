				<h2>Laura Antoniou</h2>
				
				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.lantoniou.com/" target="_blank">Laura Antoniou</a></h3>

					<h3>Ask Me If I Care; Tough Love for the Kinky</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Created in response to the informal (and often impromptu) Q&A sessions after readings, this is an interactive opportunity to talk with the author of the Marketplace series and The Killer Wore Leather.  Ask anything. Kinky queries, philosophy, books, writing & publishing, fantasies, Jewish holidays - anything. Relationship issues? Ask away. But don’t expect sugar-coated answers - this can be Tough Love for the Kinky. Dear Abby can take a hike; Laura may not care, but she respects the community enough to tell the truth formed of 30 freaking years of experience and far too many confessions. Questions may be taken in advance, asked in person or even submitted anonymously at this discussion.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Service with a Smile - Tactics for Overcoming Temporary Obstacles in Being Your Best</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Service is a way to demonstrate admiration, caring, respect, affection, and of course, love. It can also be a reward in and of itself, but that only goes so far. Fantasies, intentions, promises and expectations are all tested by real-world human behavior - and sometimes, it's just going to be a bitch to handle. Bad moods, faulty communication, illness, unexpected consequences and stress of all kinds will poke even the best of servants and wreck havoc with any relationship. Laura will discuss strategies in overcoming temporary distractions that keep a service-oriented individual from performing their best. Also addressed are questions of basic needs in a relationship, and ways of determining, for yourself, if the relationship you are in is positive or negative, whether you have temporary difficulties, or consistent ones. Workshop participants are encouraged to share ways they have discovered to keep a proper service mentality, and to being up the challenges of being servile - without hurting themselves or allowing harm from another.</p><p><b>NOTE</b> - To encourage honesty and open communication, this workshop is limited to those individuals providing service, rather than managing or receiving service.</p>

				<h2>Master Skip Chasey</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Skip Chasey, a/k/a Master Skip, addressed a crowd of nearly one million people at the Millennium March on Washington, and since then he has given more than a dozen keynote addresses and presented over 250 programs on the spiritual dynamics of BDSM at noteworthy leather events throughout North America.  He has been profiled in Nerve.com magazine, Power Exchange magazine, the award-winning documentary film Pup, and Ask the Man Who Owns him, a book on gay male Master/slave relationships that received the National Leather Association’s 2010 non-fiction literary award.  Master Skip is a co-founder of People of Leather Among You (a social and educational group for Southern California men and women interested in the integration of spirituality and leather/fetish sexuality), served as a core instructor for the Butchmanns Experience (a periodic weekend retreat offering opportunities for profound personal growth to leathermen and women of all sexual orientations and identities) and for seven years was a co-producer of Southwest Leather Conference (“The Leather Family Gathering of Heart and Spirit”).  Honors include the Leadership Award and the Lee Montague Memorial Community Service Award from Avatar Club Los Angeles, the Pantheon of Leather Community Choice Award, both the Master Heart Award and the Master Jack McGeorge Excellence in Education Award from the Master/slave Conference, and most recently the Leatherman’s Heart Award from SWLC.</p><p>In his own words, “Blood may be thicker than water, but leather is thicker than blood.”</p>

					<h3>Transparent D/s - From Projection to Reflection</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Because, as the Talmud teaches, “We don’t see things as they are, we see things as we are,” relationships of all types are often rife with projection. If such projection goes unrecognized and unaddressed, then alienation, isolation and, ultimately, dissolution of the relationship is the result. In the case of an D/s relationship, the submissive projects his or her ideas, feelings and attitudes regarding authority figures onto the Dominant, and if that projection includes anger, fear, blame or guilt, the toll it takes on both the relationship and the Dominant’s self-esteem can be tremendous. In this enlightening presentation Master Skip will explore the underlying psycho-spiritual dynamics that make it possible for a Dominant to stand in the middle of a submissive’s projection without moving, neither accepting the projection nor rejecting it and, in doing so, facilitate the submissive’s awareness of the projection, the Dominant’s strengthened sense of competency and the realization of the true nature of the relationship for them both.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>D/s Ethics and Expectations - The Value of a Personal Code</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Because D/s relationships are arguably more intentional in their construct than their “vanilla” counterparts, having advance knowledge of where you and your Dominant/submissive stand on the fundamental, practical and ethical issues facing your relationship should be a given. Yet how many of us, when confronted with challenging situations and circumstances, have been shocked to discover that not only were we ignorant of our Dom’s or sub’s POV on a particular matter, we didn’t know how we ourselves felt until we were in the thick of it? Avoiding such potentially damaging surprises is just one of the many benefits of a personal code, and in this highly-interactive presentation Master Skip will explore the necessity and value of a personal code for both Dominants and submissives, offer some tips on how to craft such a code, and then provide both time and opportunity for you to begin the crafting process for yourself.</p>

					<h3>Getting Started - Puppy 101</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Did he just bark at me? This is an introduction to puppy play for beginners and experienced players alike. We will discuss what puppy play is NOT as well as what puppy play is. We cover the basics so you can let the inner puppy come out and play in a safe and fun environment. Talking points include safety, toys, physical protection, headspace, motivation, and snacks! </p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Getting Grounded - Handler 101</h3>
					<p>
					<p>What does it mean to be a puppy handler or trainer? This introduction to puppy play is for those of us who remain upright when all the action is down on all fours. We will discuss puppy headspace and how you can contribute to make it a better and safer experience for everyone. Be prepared to get down on the floor and appreciate a pup’s-eye view of the world during this presentation.</p>

				<p>
				<p>BDSM is my lifelong passion.   A Dominant Woman who also enjoys bottoming, a community player and ritualist, I learned that consensual BDSM is a valid path to self-discovery, intimacy and sexual healing. </p><p>Out into SM in the early 80s, Leather Conferences and groups such as  LIL, NLA, Outcasts, Janus, Exiles, and Thunder In The Mountains gave me a voice as an ethical kink presenter. In 1995 I founded the Academy of S/M Arts to pass on what I had experienced with such mentors as Cynthia Slater, Joseph Bean, Mark Thompson,  and my life partner, Fakir. </p><p>My 2000  award-winning docufilm “The Pain Game,” noted for its authenticity in embodying the spirit of connected SM play has become a classic. Published in many non-fiction lifestyle books, I now blog at <a href="http://www.cleodubois.wordpress.com" target="_blank">www.cleodubois.wordpress.com</a> ... In 2008 I became part of the Living Leather Heritage of the SWLC. In 2014 was inducted into the Society of Janus’ Hall of Fame. I received along with Race bannon  the key to the Folsom Street Fair along with Race Bannon  in 2015. For the last 15 years I have offered Erotic Dominance Intensives weekends for Tops  and those who switch in San Francisco at the SF Citadel. </p><p>And I am honored and happy to return to Thunder for its 20th year!  Learn more about me at <a href="http://www.cleodubois.com" target="_blank">www.cleodubois.com</a> and on <a href="http://www.sm-arts.com" target="_blank">www.sm-arts.com</a> Thank you!</p>

					<h3>A Deeper Shade of Red – Advanced Erotic Humiliation & Degradation</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Humiliation isn’t just about smeared mascara and groveling under boots, it’s also about exploring vulnerability, trust, control, and sacrifice through absurdity, amusement, and consensual cruelty. If you’ve played with psychological torment before & are interested in learning more about your desires & potential new ways to play, then this class is definitely for you.

Fortunately, Princess Kali can make it much easier to be both strong and feminine. She’ll help you discover your dominant persona and style, offer tips on becoming comfortable in that role, show you a few basic kinky toys, get you started on using sexy verbal play, and more. She’ll even give you some ideas for bringing service submission into your play so your partner can pamper you the way you deserve! Let your powerful side out and see how much fun she can be! This workshop focuses on women with male partners.</p>

					<h3>If You Like It, You Should Put a Ring On It! Cock and Ball Accessorizing</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This highly interactive class will look at sexy, intense, and entertaining ways to “decorate” the cocks in your life. Stefanos & Shay will start with a basic discussion of anatomy, safety considerations, negotiation, and circumcised vs. intact vs. strap-on cocks, then move into formal accessories like cock rings and chastity devices — you’re encouraged to bring your favorites for “show-and-tell”!</p><p>They will then demonstrate multiple cock and ball bondage techniques, including using bondage to create a cock ring, wrapping everything up in a neat (and easy!) package, making a cock “helicopter,” creating a kynodesme (google it!), and cock bondage for chastity. Class participants are encouraged to practice along and get creative!</p><p>The instructors will provide cord for in-class use. They may be able to pair people up (or you can practice on yourself), but you’re encouraged to come to this session with a willing “stunt cock” of your own. </p><p>This class is demo, lecture, some discussion, and hands-on. Participation appreciated!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Precipice - Extreme Edge Play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Violent assault, humiliation, terror, interrogation, forced sex… playing on the brink can be vastly rewarding, but also psychologically and physically dangerous (which is of course part of the appeal). Stefanos & Shay will demonstrate & discuss types of edge play scenes, negotiation & aftercare for this type of play, and the how & why of taking yourself (and your partner/s) to the limit… and then pulling them (and yourself) back.</p><p>This class includes numerous demos, including emotional edge play, sexual consensual non-consent, gun play, use of “trigger words,” realistic and personal portrayal of domestic abuse, and rough body play, as well as participatory discussion about “soft limits” and risk awareness in the context of edge play. Throughout, Stefanos & Shay emphasize using edge play for catharsis and empowerment.</p><p>This class is not for beginners and contains content that many participants find triggering (often in unexpected ways). NO LATE ENTRY allowed for this session. </p>

				<h2>Scott Smith</h2>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Scott Smith grew up in the Northwest and began exploring the facets of S&M at an early age. With his creative and rather deviant mind, he enthusiastically developed his techniques of bondage and suspension from his experience with nautical and high angle rope work. The powerful physical interactions that became the hallmark of his S&M activities were initially necessities for various activities including white water rafting, scuba, climbing, and paramedical rescue.</p><p>Scott brings a distinct intensity and passion to the ebb and flow of learning, teaching and actualizing S&M. A believer that the magic of BDSM comes through the connection of the participants, his workshops develop and nurture that connection; while maintaining a decidedly sadistic edginess.</p><p>Starting in the early 90's, Scott has presented countless workshops and seminars throughout North America and abroad for organizations large and small. Scott is internationally known for his rope work, connection, and edge play workshops.</p><p>Having received a number of awards, Scott is incredibly honored to be a recipient of the Chicago Hellfire Club’s Caligula award.</p><p>Scott may be contacted through his email - <a href="mailto:Connect@OneWithKnots.com?subject=Questions">Connect@OneWithKnots.com</a> or his web site - <a href="http://www.OneWithKnots.com" target="_blank">www.OneWithKnots.com</a></p>
