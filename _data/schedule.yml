- title: It's a Trap - Playful Scenes & Non-Bondage Predicaments
  description: <p>This isn’t always serious work we do! Predicaments are all about putting your bottom between the proverbial rock and hard place (and laughing as they are flummoxed by their situation) - playful BDSM is about giggling together in scene and making your bottom participate in their own torment.</p><p>This class will show you how to bring a new level of engagement to your BDSM play and go beyond giving and receiving sensations – create story lines and connect mentally with your partner. Stefanos & Shay will also address the bottom’s perspective, including communicating within the “mood” of your scene and detailed discussion of “bratting.”</p><p>Leave your rope bag at home – this is NOT a bondage class! In addition to demonstrating many specific predicaments and “games,” Stefanos & Shay will discuss this type of play in a broad sense to guide you in developing your own unique scenes.</p>

- title: Skin Deep - Cutting for Play
  description: <p>There is nothing quite like the sensation of a cutting – the fear, as you see and feel a blade against your skin, the sharp, immediate pain as the cut is made, the slow tingle and wet feeling of blood dripping down your skin.</p><p>In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate surface cuttings using sterile scalpels, including information on both freehand and patterned cuttings using transfer paper. While they teach – and preach! – that you should always go into a cutting assuming it will scar, their focus in this class is to partake in cuttings as play (as opposed to cuttings as body modification) while seeking to minimize scars. There will be a focus on RACK and making cuttings as safe (with discussion by Shay, a medical professional) and sexy as possible.</p><p>While the technical information is a crucial starting point, this class will go beyond the basics, discussing cutting as spiritual play and working within a D/s dynamic. This is an advanced edge play topic. </p>

  description: <p>Religion is often a taboo subject, especially at the dinner table...  In his class Otter approaches religion and race with pure irreverence.  When diving into such taboo subjects profound experiences are guaranteed to happen so strap on your boots and leave the delicate sensitivities at the door.  This class will explore how to choose the proper play space, involving others in tertiary roles, using sacred symbols and language to evoke emotions, ways to create a ritual or religious experience through kink, and the potential catharsis and aftercare.  It cannot be stressed enough this class is not for the faint of heart...most belief systems will be discussed in reverent and irreverent ways that may be offensive to some people but entirely titillating to the rest of us.</p>

  description: <p>Covering the basics in rope bondage is particularly important.  This class not only tells you where to start, but we dive in and get our hands on each other.  Rope is not just a tool or a kink, but it is a mindset that is only confined by your imagination and willingness to explore.  You will leave this class with a few basic ties and insight into how to think rope not just tie it.  Bring your own rope, 6-8 lengths of rope.  Otter suggests 25-35 foot lengths of any of your bondage rope you like.  Also bring someone to tie on because this isn’t just a lecture.  It’s a hands-on lab setting!</p>

- title: Impact Play When You Didn't Bring Your Toy Box
  description: <p>The two most important toys are the ones you bring with you everywhere – your hands. Toys are lots of fun, but play opportunities some times happen when we aren’t expecting them or when we can’t readily get to our toys. Yet, you need to make that play happen. So, what to do? Be creative with those hands. There are many different ways the hands can be used to hit the body and its various parts. The intensity can go from delicate to mild to extreme. We will explore a variety of ways to use the hands (and arms and other body parts) for impact play. We may also explore using the hands to inflict gentle sensations to intense pain beyond the realm of impact.</p>

- title: Topping With Empathy - Getting Beyond Technique 
  description: <p>Most BDSM classes focus on equipment and technical skills – e.g., where to hit when flogging, how to prep for play piercing, different implements to use in impact play. They may include a description of how a technique might feel to the bottom – e.g. white pain, thuddy, stingy. However, even if you have experienced that scene as a bottom, your bottom may be having a very different experience than you did or than the last bottom you had the same scene with. How do you tune into your bottom, read all the messages they are giving you (verbal and non-verbal), so that you can both have an experience that leaves you satisfied and ready for another play date? We will look at how to read your bottom’s body and moans. We will examine communicating throughout a scene with various levels of directness and subtlety. We will also work on trying to develop a mind set of being able to have a foot in what our play partner is experiencing while maintaining our own top/dominant role. </p>

- title: Cathartic Flogging - Merging the Erotic and the Ecstatic
  description: <p>Webster’s defines catharsis as “an emotional purification or purgation that brings about spiritual renewal.” Catharsis provides release from tension, an increased feeling of aliveness, and can even serve as a catalyst for spiritual enlightenment. Through catharsis one can experience bliss. Provided that the proper intention, focus and egoic surrender are in place, the mindful use of a flogger provides an excellent opportunity for catharsis for both the Dom and the sub. Come discover the simple message of the flogger, and how that message can transform you…body, mind and spirit!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on flogging technique, but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice to facilitate catharsis.</p>

- title: Thunder Kiss - Love and Fear and the Single-Tail Whip
  description: <p>Who hasn’t been both attracted to—and frightened by—the crack of a single tail whip as it meets its intended target? In recent years there has been a surge of interest in single tail scenes, but the tremendous exponential function of force to sensation, not to mention the potential for serious injury, requires a learned proficiency and a disciplined focus in order to safely use such a whip on another human being. Equally important is a conscious understanding of the psycho-spiritual dynamics inherent in this intense percussive practice. In this third in a series of “Shamanic SM” presentations, Master Skip will explore those dynamics and reveal the possibility for transcendence they offer. Come discover how the mindful use of a single tail can facilitate a profound spiritual awakening, no matter which end of the whip you’re on!</p><p>Note - This is not a workshop on single tail technique but rather on how to use this powerful SM practice as a tool for Self-realization.</p>

But how can we reclaim our pleasure rights when we won’t even talk about it with our friends and lovers? In this class we will dive into the fears we have around rejection and body dysphoria, then put that all on a shelf for a few minutes to dive into what actually WORKS! How does humor and joy play into our pursuit of pleasure? What issues face trans* folks or others who are outside the binary who have male partners, female partners, trans* partners, and hell, what do you call the stuff between your legs anyway? Does it matter? We’ll touch on the issues of safer sex as well, in a community where our desperation to be touched the way we need to be touched has led to a heartbreaking habit of doing anything to get our needs met.

Inherent in this discussion is the level of responsibility of both / all partners, how to manage risk, and how you can support your partner in the aftermath. Edgy play can be hot, and we will look at ways to avoid some common pitfalls, as well as how to recover with grace and honor when things go off of the planned path.</p><p>*Please be advised - Some highly controversial scenes (i.e. racial or incest play, weaponry, etc.) will be discussed.

  description: <p>Self-identification is difficult for anyone in the alternative lifestyle. It can be even more challenging for people who see themselves as strong in their lives but desirous of submission. There is a great deal of pressure in the BDSM community to “seem submissive,” so what do you do when you see yourself as strong and fierce and yet crave mastery and domination?</p><p>Believe me, you are not alone. There are many submissives and bottoms and slaves who are strong and independent and finding their way through the maze of the Kink Community! This class is an intense discussion of self-assessment personal identification, passion and power. From those who struggle with their desire to submit, to those who strive for greater strength of purpose, this class will be a wonderful opportunity to bond with the like-minded and suss out your strength in an open setting. And for tops dominants and masters, this is an excellent opportunity to get into the mind of those who are strong and embrace the dichotomy of strength in submission and freedom in slavery!</p>
