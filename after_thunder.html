    <td><p>Thunder in the Mountains is one of the country's best national events. It ends Sunday afternoon but some folks still are all ramped up to play and hang out with other kinksters. So the Sanctuary will be open for our annual Sunday Party. Anyone who attends Thunder can attend this event. Bring your Thunder pass to the door. Any Sanctuary member (Trial or Full), even if you did NOT attend Thunder, may attend this event. If you are NOT a member and didn't attend Thunder, a current FULL member will have to guest you in. NO ORIENTATION IS OFFERED AT THIS EVENT. </p><p>This event is TNG Friendly, 19+ welcome to attend. </p><p>Door fee is $20 and includes dinner in the form of BBQ Sundaes and other yummy food. What the hell is a BBQ sundae? It is when you layer Baked Beans, BBQ beef or pork and cole slaw or potato salad in a cup, top with a roll and a pickle slice. The meat will all be gluten free and there will be lots of other sides and fruit and such for vegetarians. </p><p>Door and dungeon opens at 7:00. Dinner will be out until gone, other snacks will be out all evening. Everyone out at midnight. </p><p>Presenters always get in free. </p><p>Need location info, or other info, send a text to Love Slave at 720-989-3283. </p><p>NEED TRANSPORTATION? There will be shuttle transportation to and from the hotel for an addition fee of $2/each way which gets paid to the drivers. Drivers will be waiting to go to the club outside the SIDE doorway, not the front door starting at 6:30, until 8:30. Drivers will be making return trips until the party ends at midnight.</p>
