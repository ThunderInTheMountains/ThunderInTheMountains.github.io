				<h2>Laura Antoniou</h2>
				
				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.lantoniou.com/" target="_blank">Laura Antoniou</a></h3>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				<p>Laura Antoniou has been writing erotica for over twenty years. Best known for her Marketplace series of erotic novels about a realistic slave training society. The 6th book, The Inheritor, was launched with an enormously successful Kickstarter featuring a limited leather-bound edition; the entire series is aviailable in paper, e-book and audio editions. She has also edited and appeared in many anthologies, including Best Lesbian Erotica 2015, and is the author of Rainbow Award winning comedy kinky mystery, The Killer Wore Leather. Winner of the NLA Lifetime Achievement Award and the Pantheon of Leather Lifestime Achievement Award (both in 2011), she has presented, taught and ranted at over 150 groups, businesses, schools and conferences since the 80s. Her website is LAntoniou.com; follow her on Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>

					<h3>For Your Own Good - Using Punishment in your SM Relationships</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Laura will explore the reasons for, and effective methods of punishment to enhance and strengthen a relationship based upon authority and obedience.  Drawing from her personal experience and longtime observations, Laura will discuss punishment and its myths, uses, limits, and how to create punishments that are appropriate to the moment, while being erotic and enjoyable to the enforcer. You will learn how to use punishment  to benefit both top and bottom and reinforce the values of your relationship.</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Ask Me If I Care; Tough Love for Tough Players</h3>
					<p>
					<p>This class was created in response to the informal (and sometimes impromptu) Q&A sessions after readings and it is an interactive opportunity to talk with the author of the Marketplace series. Don’t expect sugar-coated answers - this is Tough Love for tops, bottoms, couples and/or other groupings. Dear Abby can take a hike; Laura may not care, but she respects the community enough to tell the truth. Questions may be submitted anonymously or bravely offered at this discussion. Sacred cows may be slaughtered. Triggering is almost certainly going to happen for someone. And there will absolutely be laughs. If you have questions for this wise and outspoken icon of the BDSM literary world, you should either write them down or memorize them to bring up in the class.  But be warned…..your question will be answered with TRUTH!</p>

					<h3>Belt Bondage for Rough Sex.…Buckle Up and Fuck!</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Even the most basic belt can be used in dozens of ways to restrain your partner for effective and minimalist bondage or rough sex either used alone or in combination with other belts, devices, and furniture. Such implements can also be used for a variety of creative and intense impact play options. In this hands on class, Danarama will demonstrate and coach you on the fast and effective uses of one of the most common items nearly everyone has on hand.

					<h3>Creative Mindfuckery</h3>
					<p>
					<p>The physical aspects of S/m can only go so far in taking people into subspace. Headspace is where it's at. But you don't have to be a hypnotist, psychologist or shaman to get there. Danarama shares a wide range of techniques, from communication-flytraps to home-built props and sleights of hand that you can use to delve into your partner's mind and play upon their fears in ways that are terrifyingly realistic and effective, yet physically safe and easily wiped away like a bad dream. Featuring live demonstrations, craft instructions, basic practical magicianship and discussions into the darker sides like interrogation and brainwashing, Dan will arm you with the tools to take your scenes to a new dimension. </p><p><ol><li>Brain-stalking, f.k.a.

					<h3>Breath Play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Obviously breath play is considered one of the most dangerous and edgy of all BDSM activities, requiring responsibility, trust, and scrupulous safety practices on the part of both the top and the bottom. In this workshop Mark Frazier will focus on different & varied methods used to restrict a person’s breathing in order to facilitate the release of endorpohans that we all crave. Mark will also focus on safety concerns and how to minimize the occurrence of any potential problems. At the end of the informational part of this class, Mark will conclude with a hands-on demonstration.</p><p>We would like to note that Mark has been teaching this class for almost 30 years, and he tells us that this will be the last time he teaches it. So, if you want to avail yourself of Mark’s 30 years of experience and information, this is a class you cannot miss!</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Fisting</h3>
					<p>
					<p> Handing complete control of your sphincter, your anus, your rectum, and your lower colon to another human being can be one of the most daunting experiences a person can undergo.   This type of play involves a huge level of trust by the fistee of the fister, but once this trust has been established, fisting can become one of the most personally emotional and satisfying types of play anyone can participate in.   As a result, fisting becomes one of the most intimate ways to touch and make love to another person.  In this class, Mark Frazier will discuss the proper techniques of entry by the top, ways to relax by the bottom, the safety concerns, and dealing with the unreal feeling of "openness" and connection with another person.  If you are one of those people who wants to experience this beautiful type of play or if you are one of those who have already indulged in it and want to learn more, then this is a class you HAVE to attend! </p><p>Bottom Wanted - Interested in bottoming for this seminar, contact e-mail via <a href="mailto:rich@thunderinthemountains.com?subject=Frazier Demo Bottom">rich@thunderinthemountains.com</a></p>

					<h3>Sensual Domination - A Kinky Tutorial in Erotic S&M</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Everything in a scene can be made sensual; everything can be made dominant. Instead of bondage being the means to an end, make it the END in itself.

If you are one of those lucky players who has always sensed the true potency of sensual domination, then this is a class you will most definitely want to attend.</p>

				<p>Midori is a renowned educator and writer on sexuality. Dubbed “the super nova of kink” by Dan Savage, she emerged from the Sex Positive Movement in San Francisco in the early 1990’s, soon becoming a much sought after international presenter on sexuality, personal fulfillment and kinky adventures.</p><p>Her reputation as authority and leading expert on alternative pleasures stem not only from her unique and entertaining process of teaching concrete skills, but in her ability to deconstruct and distill complex matters of desire into surprisingly accessible lessons with eloquence and humanity. She’s known for tackling challenging topics with fresh and relevant insights. She calls this her “head-heart-hands” method to create a space where people are allowed individual self-exploration. Fundamentally she is motivated by helping people to create authentic and intimate relationships while emphasizing self actualization, shame reduction, acceptance and justice.</p><p>Her writing is extensive, ranging from numerous articles, columns, works of fiction, to instructional books. She is the author of The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage, Wild Side Sex, and Master Han's Daughter.  She leads transformative small group intensives, including Rope Dojo ®, ForteFemme - Women’s Dominance Weekend Intensive and Passionate Bonds - Creating Effective D/s Protocol.  When she's not traveling and teaching, she's creating provocative and haunting art and performances.</p><p>Support her fight against HIV!

How do you find a sexy style of erotic dominance that's authentic to you? Using a special technique she developed, Midori will help you to find your inner power femme archetype, allowing you to pursue erotic fulfillment of sensual power play. This class is not your typical how-to instruction.  Instead, you'll discover the difference between constructive and destructive desires and point you towards ways of bringing satisfaction in bedroom play for both you and your partner. </P<p>Midori will share with you her secrets of the feminine art of dominance. She will discuss the psychology, practical exercises, techniques, fashion, how to discover what makes your partner weak-kneed, and more. </p><p>This class is not limited to a gender, but is intended for all who harbor the powerful feminine within!

					<h3>Scarf Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Do you want to bring sizzling, sexy, fun, and easy erotic bondage to your bedroom without having to bother with expensive gear or complicated ropes? In this class Midori will show you how to combine sex with super easy bondage using beautiful, stealthy scarves! You will learn fun sexy position techniques and how to change positions quickly. Midori will also teach you safe non-rope ties for sex in various positions, sexual sensation enhancement with good positions, and more.</p><p>This class also includes Midori’s Scarf Dildo Harness! </p><p>Midori came up with this totally simple, amazing “do-it-yourself” Dildo Harness design. It’s also known as the Midori Elegant Harness.  It’s great for all body types, genders, and configuration of bits. It works great with after-market, store-bought or original-issue-self-sprouted bits. It proves itself remarkably stable  and fantastic for insertable dildos!  Clever and simple. Midori will bring all of the tools for the class and some dildoes, but you are all welcome to bring your own. </p><p>Some scarves will be available too - but if you have a couple of long scarves or ropes, you should bring them.  There will be practice time.  So please bring a beach towel or yoga mat and a pillow or two if you like. You should wear comfortable clothing. (All the exercises will be fully clothed.) Bring scarves if you like. Otherwise equipment and scarves will be provided.</p>

				<h3>Website: <a href="http://www.stefanosandshay.com" target="_blank">Stefanos and Shay</a></h3>
				

				<p></p>
				<p>
				Stefanos & Shay (StefanosandShay.com) are a vivacious, unconventional D/s couple whose entertaining, information-packed classes have been called "better than a Vegas act.” They identify as pansexual polyamorous playsluts, purveyors of perversion, and alliteration fetishists! They are based in San Francisco, where they host over 80 events a year (including BENT, Twisted Windows, Master’s Den, Self-Suspension Open Space, & Bondage-a-Go-Go) and were named King & Queen of Pervert's Prom in 2006!<p>Shay is an ER nurse by day, education director for Dark Odyssey - Surrender and the SF Citadel by night, while Stefanos is all kink all the time as the Producer/Steward of The Upper Floor on Kink.com and DM & CEO of Bondage-a-Go-Go. Together they hold the title of International Power Exchange 2014 and have performed, presented, and hosted around the country and internationally.</p>

					<h3>In Your Place - Headspace & Protocols for Power Exchange</h3>
					<p>
					<p>"Headspace” is a much-ballyhooed concept in BDSM, especially when it comes to power exchange. While it can seem like a nebulous idea, there are very specific  things you can do to get into headspace, or help your partner(s) find theirs. In this interactive class, Stefanos & Shay will draw from their years of experience in an unconventional D/s relationship  to discuss & demonstrate the use of protocols and other methods to establish a D/s dynamic for a scene. They will start with specific verbal protocols, including manners of address and communicating within the “mood” of your scene (particularly from the s-type’s perspective). Next they’ll cover physical protocols, with a focus on position training. This class focuses on scene-based (vs. everyday) power exchange. Throughout the class, Stefanos & Shay will aim to help you create and individualize protocols for your own unique dynamics. (This class contains elements of demo, lecture, discussion, and class interaction.)</p>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Pyro-Passion - Fire play</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Take your fire play beyond the basics! In this class, Stefanos & Shay will discuss and demonstrate methods for making your fire play sensual, erotic, and painless… or “punishing” the masochist in your life with a scary and sadistic fire scene. They will explain pyro tools, safety, executing a scene and psychology of pyro-passion, followed by specific techniques including fire with wands, spraying, flashing, bubbles, foam, and cupping. Fire play requires constant attention to the details of the process as well as the rewards- this class emphasizes safety and mindfulness. At the end of the session, there will be an intense demo bringing all these skills together. (This class is demo and lecture, with some class participation/discussion.)</p>

					<h3>Power Flogging</h3>
					<p>
					<p>In this class Lolita will teach you how to get the most out of your flogging stroke and how to have the stamina to outlast those tough, piggy bottoms.  She will demonstrate how body angle and footwork are important for accuracy and for achieving a variety of sensations.

					<h3>Tying a Pretty Package - Cock & Ball Bondage</h3>
					<p>
					<p>Whether you know it or not, genital bondage is the most popular form of cock & ball torture. This will be a hands-on class where Lolita will teach you  a variety of ways to tie up the family jewels. She will provide all of the materials you will need and you should bring a partner! You’ll see how well he responds to having his cock and balls restrained, stretched and manipulated. If you are single, show up anyway and we will try to match people up----those who want to tie up the sausages and those who want their sausages wrapped in rope.
