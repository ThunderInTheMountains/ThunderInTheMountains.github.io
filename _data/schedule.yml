- title: Bare Bones Bondage 
  description: <p>In this class Lizard will teach a series of simple and efficient ties designed to restrain, contort, and torture. These ties are both easy for the top and challenging for the bottom. Most of these can be done with one (sometimes, two) lengths of rope, and with practice, can be done in under two minutes for each tie. For beginners, that means you will spend less time reviewing the steps of a takate kote on youtube, and more time spent connecting with your partner. These ties make great scene starters, whether you’re doing rope for the sake of rope, or using restraint as a means to do sensation play, impact play, sex play, etc.</p><p>To participate you will need to bring 2 lengths of natural fiber rope (7-8 meters each), an emergency rope cutting tool, suspension hardware (optional), and note taking supplies (optional).</p>

- title: Responsible Bottoming for Everyone
  description: <p>Contrary to what it may sometimes seem, bottoms are not just interchangeable bodies whose only responsibilities are listing limits, taking pain and occasionally using safe wording. A great bottom can help a top get more out of a scene, elevate a scene from good to great, and even open the door to even edgier types of play.  Honey will begin by discussing what can make an experience  great for both the top and the bottom, and what you can do to enhance the experience, even if you're not the one throwing rope or a whip. She will then move on to talk about types of effective negotiation and communication during scenes, as well as ways to protect yourself and what to do if things go awry. She will examine everything from light pickup play to safely exploring heavier and edgier play, and various types of consent models. Regardless of what you're interested in, Honey will help you to be a more informed partner, as well as giving you  the tools you need in order to foster an amazing scene--from the bottom!  Whether you are a top or the bottom, this is a class you won’t want to miss!</p>

- title: Fisting
  description: <p> Handing complete control of your sphincter, your anus, your rectum, and your lower colon to another human being can be one of the most daunting experiences a person can undergo.   This type of play involves a huge level of trust by the fistee of the fister, but once this trust has been established, fisting can become one of the most personally emotional and satisfying types of play anyone can participate in.   As a result, fisting becomes one of the most intimate ways to touch and make love to another person.  In this class, Mark Frazier will discuss the proper techniques of entry by the top, ways to relax by the bottom, the safety concerns, and dealing with the unreal feeling of "openness" and connection with another person.  If you are one of those people who wants to experience this beautiful type of play or if you are one of those who have already indulged in it and want to learn more, then this is a class you HAVE to attend! </p>

- title: Anticipatory Service, “The Felicity of Foresight”
  description: <p>There are many manners and modes of service established throughout the D/s lifestyle. Anticipatory Service is one ‘manner of service’ in which the submissive or slave strives to fulfill the Master’s, or Mistress’s needs and desires before a command is issued. It is but one brand of service, but one that nurtures and deepens the dynamic that exists in a D/s and M/s Leather relationship. It is one that requires devotion, patience, and self-examination among other elements, but its result is a seamless state-of-mind service that shines through the actualization of action and behavior, from the simple tasks to any formal activity. Lady Marquetta and her slave, Leonis, invite you to join them as they guide you through the beauty and elegance of this perceptive manner of service. This will be an interactive class and they encourage participation off all attendees in order to engage in some “hands-on” experience.</p>

- title: The Elegant Art of High Protocol
  description: <p>The term "High Protocol" can, and often inspires images of reserved revelry and dignified duty. It also, however, can incite intimidation, bewilderment, and an intense amount of stress. These interpretations of High Protocol, furthermore, result in the same thing, a highly rewarding, and elegant experience for the Host/Hostess, the Masters and Mistresses, and the slaves as well, who attend, participate and enjoy its every facet.</p><p>We will examine and discuss, of course, High Protocol Events, including High Protocol Dinners. What are they, what are they not. We will survey their attributes, and benefits for the Leather Community, and consider the many unseen elements of High Protocol. For instance, the kitchen staff at a High Protocol Dinner. Their contribution is a seamless symphony of preparation, flawless presentation, and choreographed service which creates an unrivaled and unmatched performance of elegance that no five-star restaurant can match. The mystery of High Protocol remains a steadfast component, and an emotive event within our Lifestyle origins. This class will attempt to demystify the elements and allow the entire community to embrace its grandeur. Lady Marquetta and her slave, Leonis, invite you to join them as they explain the intrinsic aspects of mental domination and how guiding the mind deepens the host of dynamics present in our Lifestyle.</p>

  description: <p>"Headspace” is a much-ballyhooed concept in BDSM, especially when it comes to power exchange. While it can seem like a nebulous idea, there are very specific  things you can do to get into headspace, or help your partner(s) find theirs. In this interactive class, Stefanos & Shay will draw from their years of experience in an unconventional D/s relationship  to discuss & demonstrate the use of protocols and other methods to establish a D/s dynamic for a scene. They will start with specific verbal protocols, including manners of address and communicating within the “mood” of your scene (particularly from the s-type’s perspective). Next they’ll cover physical protocols, with a focus on position training. This class focuses on scene-based (vs. everyday) power exchange. Throughout the class, Stefanos & Shay will aim to help you create and individualize protocols for your own unique dynamics.
