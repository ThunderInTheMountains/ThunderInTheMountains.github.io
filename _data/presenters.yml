- name: Dart
  title: 
  linkname: 
  linkurl: 
  bio: Master Dart's interest in leather and BDSM play can be traced as far back as his early childhood years, citing a huge fascination with what was being done to don the “Batman” television series…and to the furry cowboys on “Gunsmoke.” When other boys were caught with porn magazines under their beds…Dart was caught with a roll of duct tape. Since then he has developed an immense passion for rope bondage, not to mention the men he likes to tie up with it. Dart began his leather journey as a collared boy and gradually developed into the dominant he is today. He believes in the importance of “balance” when exploring one’s dominant and submissive side in play, and that great benefit can come from experiencing both elements. Master Dart’s kinky interests in addition to rope bondage include puppy play and training, chest and gut punching, and most recently, fire play. He sees himself as "proudly New Guard" because he feels that what is most important is not what happened in the past but what is happening NOW, and that our sexual self-expression should not be hindered by rigid or judgmental 'rules' from our past.  Among the cities, organizations and events Dart has presented in include sitting on the educational board for “Mr. Leatherman Toronto,”  “Spring Iniquity” in Houston, “Thunder in the Mountains” in Denver,  “GEAR Ireland” in Dublin,  “Leather Pride” in Amsterdam, and the “Rome BDSM Conference.”   He also hosts his own leather podcast program on ITunes, called “Dart’s Domain.” He shares his life with his husband Sir Bart. They reside in Virginia Beach, VA.

  class1title: Landmines
  class1description: In kink and BDSM, we all bring a certain amount of 'baggage' to the table. And some of us even bring freight!   While these are elements of what makes us all human, they can become a critical issue when it comes to the intensity of the power exchange that exists in a kink relationship. A LANDMINE refers to what happens when a negative element of our past gets triggered during the course of that relationship, be it in play or otherwise. In this class Master Dart will facilitate a discussion about some of the possible landmines that can come up in the course of a D/s relationship or playscene, and how we can deal their accidental detonation and grow from them.

Dart’s demonstration will show both handlers and future “pups” the playful elements and the psychology in this fun and popular form of play.

  class1title: Choose Your Own Edge Play Adventure
  class1description: Do you find Dexter's kill room to be scary and erotic? Have you gotten aroused by war crimes depicted in a documentary? This is dark, potentially dangerous stuff to play with, but in this class as a small group we will explore these feelings with an emphasis on bringing those fantasies to life in a safe and risk- aware manner. We will dissect several examples of realistic, potentially criminal activities with the purpose of figuring out how to safely enact a fantasy version of those. Many of these examples use restraints less commonly found in kink which each carry their own risks.  In order to decrease the risk we will discuss, demonstrate, and use specific means of restraint and destruction.  If you have ever found yourself fixating on some of the darker aspects of real-life crimes and you have craved some sort of guidance to play safely in these realms, this is a class you won't want to miss!

  class2title: Rape Play - From Curious about to in to in one class
  class2description: According to many surveys, one of the most popular fantasies among both gay and straight audiences is that of rape.  Through force or coercion and independent of gender, rape play can be terrifying and erotic for both the top and bottom.  In this class Frozen Meursault will take a "how-to" approach on a number of actionable teaching points for attendees to begin employing as they explore rape play in the scene. Safety issues will be stressed with an emphasis placed on recognizing risks and mitigating them to give participants a foundation upon which to build as they enter this psychologically tricky form of play. By focusing more on practical points than lofty discussions this class is an effective jumping off point for actual, hot sexual play.
